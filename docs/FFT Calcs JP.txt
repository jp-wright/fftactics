*For PHYS AT = scale of 20?  scale of "per weapon?" at lvl 1 or 99?  Ninja w/ 2 Chaos Blades?

*after all this I also want to somehow develop a standard scoring scale (i.e. similar to how IQ tests are rated, or SAT/ACTs, etc.) for each class as a whole.  So, in effect, I want to compile all the numbers and actually rank the classes in an overall, final manner.  To say that the Ninja is statistically the most privileged class, etc.

*Standardize Scores?   (e.g. PAT scale of 20 converted to new scale along with HP of 999?)

*Weighted Rankings?  (e.g Ninja is in top quarter of x categories...)

*More damage in 16 rounds: Ninja with /\ speed or /\ Phys. AT?  And what Support abilities? (Martial Arts, AT up?)


Stats in FFT work like this:
1. Calculate the base level stat for each class and gender (I’ve done this below in tables).  Do this with the equations in [Job Base Stats].  These are your underlying “raw” or “core” stats.  These are not displayed in the game, they are just the “true” stats for each character.  They are modified by only one thing: leveling up.  I explain how this works below.

2. When leveling up in FFT, the amount of “stat improvement” you obtain is based on what class you are at the time of level up.  Different class have different stat growth factors, shown below in [Job Growth Divisors].  These are called “C-values.” The equation describing how stats are modified during a level up for a given class is below in the [Job Growth Divisors] section.  (This same equation applies in reverse for leveling down, and as such allows you to level up in one class for a big benefit to a specific stat, and then level down as a different class to incur a smaller penalty to that same stat. This means you return to the original level with an improved stat.  Repeating this allows maximization of all stats).  Again, these are your “raw” stats.  These level up modifications are permanent, they are part of the character.


3. Each job class also modifies your “raw” stats to become your “functional” stats (i.e. the ones displayed in your character profile page). These are simply temporary modifications of your “raw” stats and are not permanent. For example, being a Knight boosts your PA (by 20%) while you are a Knight, but this boost disappears when you change to a different class (ignoring equipment).  It is not part of your character’s “raw” stats.  These modified stats are the ones used in calculations during battle, which is why a Knight does 20% more damage on a base ATTACK than a Thief, for example (controlling for the same weapon).  These multipliers are listed in the [Class Multipliers] section.  So, your HP, for example, at level 31 as a Monk is determined by what class(es) you were when leveled up each level from 1 to 31.

4. Equipment also modified stats, but that is fairly straightforward.

HPP, MPP, SpP, PAP, and MAP are increased on level up.  Different classes -- 
as well as different sexes -- receive different statpoint bonuses on level up, 
which results in the classes' differing stat growth.

Stat point growth on levelling up is determined by the following equation:

                        bonus = [current_xP / (C + Lv)]

   where xP is a generic term for any stat point (HPP, MPP, SpP, PAP or MAP)
         Lv is the LOWER level in question -- so if you are levelling up
            from 50 to 51, Lv = 50.

JP EXPERIMENT
*More damage in 16 rounds: Ninja with /\ speed or /\ Phys. AT?  And what Support abilities? (Martial Arts, AT up?)






Points of consideration:
* Granting 100% to-hit (for now at least)
* # of rounds (do multiples of 5)
* Phy AT BASE
* Phy AT modified (AT Up, martial arts, etc.) {see BMG for Dmg. Mods}
* Weapon Power (2x Chaos Blades w/ equip sword, or 2 Iga Knifes (or whatever they are))
* Do calcs. for weakest and strongest weapon in class to see effect of weap. power.
* Weapon dmg. formula
* Speed stat BASE
* Speed stat Modified (Short Charge = VOID/No Effect on Spd.)
* Move and Act vs. only Act.
* Haste

* Clockticks (i.e. speed) explained:
Clocktick performed every turn, if not one's CT will =100 in one move, clockticks (i.e. speed increments of given char's speed value) are preformed until someone is >= 100. 
(So, for example, if only 2 ppl are left and MobA has a speed of 9 and MobZ 14, with MobA's CT=55 and MobZ's CT=45, MobZ will still go first; b/c each clocktick = +14 to CT for MobZ, while only +9 to CT for MobA.  	
	So MobA: 55+9= 64 +9= 73 +9= 82 +9= 91 +9= 100 ...5 clockticks for 100.
	   MobZ: 45+14= 59 +14= 73 +14= 87 +14= 101 ...4 clockticks for 100 (101 actually, and the remainder of 1 DOES carry over.)

DAMAGE MODIFIERS
----------------

Many factors -- including the attacker's abilities and status, the
target's abilities and status, as well as Zodiac compatibility -- can
affect the damage done by weapon attacks.  The procedure outlined below
is a summary of how to apply all these different modifiers.

'XA' below stands for whatever expression that the weapon multiplies by
Weapon Power to get the final damage.  For example, XA = PA for swords,
XA = [(PA + Sp) / 2] for longbows, and XA = WP for physical guns.

If there are multiple instances of the _same_ statistic in a damage
equation (for instance, the non-magic gun and barehand equations), only
modify _one_ instance of the statistic.  See section 1.7 for a
clarification on this.

Let 'XA0' be the attacker's XA on the stat screen.  The 'Attacker' is the
unit making the attack, and the 'Defender' is the unit being attacked.

   1. If this is a critical hit, then XA1 = XA0 + (1..XA0) - 1.  See
      section 2.1 for details.
   2. If the weapon is endowed with an Element, and the attacker has
      equipment that 'Strengthens' that element, then (XA2 = [XA1 * 5/4]),
      else XA2 = XA1
   3. If attacker has Attack UP, then (XA3 = [XA2 * 4/3]), else XA3 = XA2
   4. If attacker has Martial Arts and is barehanded, then
      (XA4 = [XA3 * 3/2]), else XA4 = XA3
   5. If attacker is Berserk, then (XA5 = [XA4 * 3/2]), else XA5 = XA4
   6. If defender has Defense UP, then (XA6 = [XA5 * 2/3]), else XA6 = XA5
   7. If defender has Protect, then (XA7 = [XA6 * 2/3]), else XA7 = XA6
   8. If defender is Charging, then (XA8 = [XA7 * 3/2]), else XA8 = XA7
   9. If defender is Sleeping, then (XA9 = [XA8 * 3/2]), else XA9 = XA8
  10. If defender is a Chicken and/or a Frog, then (XA10 = [XA9 * 3/2]),
      else XA10 = XA9
  11. Apply zodiac multipliers:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/4]))
          elseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/4])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/2])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/2])
          else XA11 = XA10
  12. Apply weapon's damage formula using XA = XA11 (if there is more
      than one instance of XA, only set _one_ instance to XA11 and
      leave the other as XA0 (see above).
