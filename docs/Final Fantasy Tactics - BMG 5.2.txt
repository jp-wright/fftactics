Wow... it's getting huge. The BMG now weighs in at over 550 K! In recognition
of this fact, with this version I've made it easier than ever to find what you
need using your text editor or web brower's Find/Search feature. Take a look at
the Contents and the beginning of section 3.3 for tips on searching the BMG. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

For updates to the BMG, look on these websites:

* http://www.fftactics.net/fftmech/
       The FFT Battle Mechanics Guide homepage.  Find the latest version
       of the Guide along with an archive of previous versions. Special 
       thanks go to George Greer for allowing me to host the site on his 
       server space.

* http://www.gamefaqs.com/
       New versions of the BMG, unless they contain extremely minor
       revisions, will usually be posted to GameFAQs as well.  This is a
       wonderful site and, if you haven't been there, you've got to check
       it out!

TO SKIP TO A SECTION: Find (Ctrl + F) the number of the section between
brackets. For instance, if you wanted to skip to section 9.3, you would
Find "[9.3]" (without the quotes). (No, there is no 9.3. This is to prevent
you from Finding this description when you search for a section number!)

[1.1] definitions             
      =========================================================================
                              
Here are a few definitions of terms that will recur throughout the rest of the
guide.                        
                              
- A UNIT is any person or monster on the battlefield.
                              
- An attack (lowercase) is any action taken by a unit in battle except for 
  'Move', 'Defend', 'Wait', or 'Equip Change'. ATTACK, in uppercase, refers
  to the specific command ATTACK.

- The CASTER is the unit executing an attack. This doesn't necessarily have 
  to refer to spells; a unit striking another with a sword is a 'caster' as 
  well.  This is somewhat counterintuitive, but it is easier to refer to
  all executors of attacks as 'casters' rather than using the words 'caster',
  'attacker', 'stealer', etc. to refer to what is basically the same thing.

- The TARGET is the unit(s) on the receiving end of the attack.
  The caster and target can be the same unit.

- DAMAGE refers to loss of HP or MP.  Unless otherwise stated, assume that
  the term 'damage' refers to HP damage.

- An EFFECTIVE statistic is one that is not actually displayed on
  the status screen in the game, but is used internally by the game
  for calculation of the formula in which it appears.

- PHYSICAL AT (PA) is the number next to the sword icon on the middle
  panel of the status screen.  It indicates a character's physical
  attack power.  In this guide, Physical AT is usually abbreviated
  'PA'.  A unit can have a PA no less than 1 and no greater than 99.
  Note: if your PA is high enough, you can actually raise your 
  effective PA higher than 99 with Attack UP or Martial Arts.

- MAGICAL AT (MA) is the number next to the sceptre icon on the middle
  panel of the status screen.  It indicates a character's magical
  ability.  In this guide, Magical AT is usually abbreviated as
  'MA'.  Like PA, this statistic is bounded by 1 and 99.  Also like
  PA, if your MA is high enough, you can raise your effective MA higher 
  than 99 with Magic Attack UP.

- An ATTACK STAT (XA) is a general term that can stand for any 
  statistic -- usually PA, MA, or Speed -- that may influence the damage 
  or success rate of an attack.  It is used in discussions where the 
  same formula applies to two types of attacks, but different stats are 
  plugged into the formula for each attack.  For instance, rods and 
  staves share the damage formula of XA * WP, where the attack stat
  XA = PA for rods and XA = MA for staves.

- An ACTIVE TURN (AT, or simply TURN) occurs when a character is
  given the option to Move, Act, and/or Wait.  Do not confuse
  this with the AT in physical AT and magic AT, which stands for
  'attack' and has nothing to do with this.

- WEAPON POWER is a property of weapons which determines their strength. 
  It can be seen on the middle panel of the status screen, next to the 
  letter of the appropriate hand ('R' or 'L'). 

- A PHYSICAL ATTACK is one that meets at least ONE of the three following 
  criteria:
  (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
      having Attack UP
  (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
      having Defense UP or Protect status
  (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's physical evade.

- A MAGICAL ATTACK is one that meets at least ONE of the three following 
  criteria:
  (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
      having Magic AttackUP
  (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
      having Magic DefendUP or Shell status.
  (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's magical evade.
  (In general, magical attacks that have beneficial effects, such as 
   Cure and Protect are not susceptible to Shell, Magic DefendUP, or 
   magic evade.)

- A NEUTRAL ATTACK is defined as one that is neither physical nor 
  magical.  Examples include TALK SKILL, DANCE, SING, the DRAW OUT 
  ability 'Murasame', and the Bomb's 'Self-Destruct' command.

- A CLOCKTICK is the basic unit of time of an FFT battle.  During
  one clocktick, each unit's CT meter increases by an amount equal
  to the unit's Speed.  Strictly, a clocktick is defined as the 
  period of time between two consecutive S+ phases (don't worry about
  this now; see the gameflow section, Appendix A, for details).

- A SLOW ACTION is any attack which requires a charging time between
  the time it is selected and the time when it is actually executed.
  Each slow action has an associated value known as 'ctr' (clockticks
  till resolution) which specifies this duration in clockticks.  See 
  the gameflow section for details.

- A FAST ACTION is any attack which is resolved immediately upon 
  selection.  See the gameflow section, Appendix A, for details.

- A REACTION is any attack immediately executed by the target of a 
  just-resolved slow action, fast action, or act of mimicry.  
  Reaction abilities cannot be reacted to or mimed.  The nature of 
  the reaction is determined by a unit's reaction ability.

- BRAVE, which is listed on-screen under the character's name and
  occupation, is a stat which supposedly represents courage in
  battle.  It's a factor in a few special skills and some
  weapon attacks, and also represents the rate at which you'll
  use your Reaction Ability.  In this guide, you will see it
  abbreviated as 'Br'.  Brave is on a scale from 0 to 100; if you
  fall below 10 Brave, you'll be afflicted with the Chicken status
  ailment (i.e., figurative chickens become literal chickens).

- FAITH, listed on-screen next to Brave, is supposed to represent
  belief in miracles and supernatural phenomena.  It factors into
  both magic damage and rate of success, and is an important
  stat for a mage.  We abbreviate it here as 'Fa'.  Like Brave,
  it varies from 0 to 100.  Any character except for Ramza or a 
  Guest that has Faith exceeding 90 at the end of a battle will 
  leave the party.

- To ADD a status change is to cause a unit to be affected by that
  status change.

- To CANCEL a status change is to remove a status change that had 
  previously been added to a unit.

- The RANGE of an attack is the number of squares, counted in a
  straight line, that the attack has the potential to target (not
  counting the caster himself). It is represented on the screen when 
  an attack is selected by red, glowing panels.  Examples:

  (X = Caster)
                            #           #
                  #        ###          #
        #        ###      #####         #
       #X#      ##X##    ###X###     ###X###
        #        ###      #####         #
                  #        ###          #
     Range 1   Range 2      #           #
                          Range 3     Range 3
                                     (4 directions)
    
    Usually, Range is independent of vertical height, but for some
    skills (e.g., TALK SKILL), it can be limited by height difference.
    If this is so, it will be noted in the guide with a "vX" after
    the range number, where X is the vertical tolerance of the attack
    in height units.  For instance, the range of 'Threaten' is 3v2.
    
- The EFFECT AREA of an attack determines which panels will actually be
  hit by the attack.  It's determined by counting the number of squares
  an attack can hit from the centre to one corner of the effect area.
  Effect area is usually restricted by height.  Height restrictions will 
  be noted in the guide with "vX" appended on to the effect number, with 
  X being the vertical tolerance of the attack in height units.  For 
  instance, the effect area of 'Haste 2' is 2v3.

  Examples:
                           O
                 O        OOO
      O         OOO      OOOOO
                 O        OOO
                           O
   Effect 1   Effect 2  Effect 3

   A combination of range and effect area is used to determine the 
   attack's firing range.  We represent this in the guide as two numbers,
   the first being the range and the second the effect area.  For 
   instance, a spell with firing range {5/1} means it has a range of 5
   and an effect area of 1. If there is an effect area greater than one,
   it can make the attack go further than the range. 

   Special firing ranges:

   - for LINEAR firing ranges, the range is measured in the number of 
     directions the line can go in.  The effect area is measured by 
     the number of squares it affects, and the number of directions 
     in which it does so.  For example, the 'Holy Explosion' attack 
     is {4dir/5(1dir)}.

   - for AUTOMATIC firing ranges, the range and the effect area are
     always the same.  This is denoted by {A/N}, where N is the 
     number of squares, in a straight line counted from the centre 
     of the effect area, that the attack effects. For instance, {A/3} 
     is illustrated below.  If the attack is helpful, the caster will
     usually also be targeted; if the attack is harmful, the caster
     will usually not be targeted. 

   X: caster
   #: panel in range
   O: affected panel

              O
             OOO          O                
             #O#          O                   O
      O     #####         O                  OOO
     #X#   ###X###     ###X###              OOXOO
      #     #####         #                  OOO
             ###          #                   O
              #           #                
     1/1     3/2    4directions/             A/3
                    3(1direction)    (caster may or may not
                                      be affected.)

- LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) means that the target of an attack must lie along
  a roughly linear path from the caster without any obstacles or other units
  intervening.  For longbows, this path can be concave-down parabolic as well
  as linear (the arrow can arc) If an obstacle blocks the line of sight, a 
  line-of-sight attack will fail.  If another unit blocks the line of sight, 
  the attack will be executed on the other unit instead of the intended 
  target.  This can be used to your advantage with guns and bows to hit 
  targets that are closer than 3 panels (which can't normally be fired on):  
  target a panel directly behind the unit you want to hit, and since he 
  blocks your shot, you'll hit the intended target instead!  Sometimes 
  this won't work with longbows because the arrow will arc over the 
  intervening target.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[1.2] abbreviations & symbols
      =========================================================================

Listed below are abbreviations and symbols, both mathematical and
game-related, that will be used throughout the guide.


MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
----------------------

ARITHMETIC
* signifies multiplication
/ signifies division

FFT uses integer division, meaning that it truncates all remainders.  To
emphasize this, I place instances of division within square brackets:

                              [20 / 4] = 5
                              [21 / 4] = 5
                              [22 / 4] = 5
                              [23 / 4] = 5
                              [24 / 4] = 6

As the above implies, [x] in this guide means to truncate x -- that is, 
convert x to a decimal and then drop all decimal places, regardless of what 
numbers they contain.  Forinstance, [3.001] = 3; [3.999] = 3; [0.556] = 0; 
[-0.872] = 0; [-7.25] = -7.  Note that this differs from the greatest 
integer (floor) function in its treatment of negative numbers:  [-9.1] = -9 
while floor(-9.1) = -10.  FFT uses truncation, not floor.

The symbol [x * y/z] is short-hand for [(x * y)/z].

In a few instances, the game will round the result of a division UP instead
of dropping the remainder.  To deal with this, I define the 'round-up 
division' function, RU{x / y} as follows:

                       RU{x,y} = [(x + y - 1) / y]

This is more intuitive if you think of it as dividing X by Y and rounding up 
to the nearest integer.

MAXIMUM & MINIMUM FUNCTIONS
max{x,y} = (x if x > y) or (y if y > x)
Intuitively, this function means to take whichever is largest of the two
options separated by the comma.

min{x,y} = (x if x < y) or (y if y < x)
Similarly, this means to take whichever is the smallest of the two options
in the brackets.

RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION
(x..y) means that the game generates a random integer between x and y,
inclusive.

HEXADECIMAL
Where it is necessary for clarity, hexadecimal numbers are prefaced by a 
"$" character. So "$2710" means 2710 hex, or 10,000 decimal.

[1.3] signs of the zodiac
      =========================================================================

What would the Zodiac Brave Story be without Zodiac compatibility?  
Every unit in FFT has a Zodiac sign.  The interaction of the Zodiac signs 
is almost always an effect in damage calculation.  The few attacks which are
exempt from Zodiac compatibility include

     (1) Damaging attacks where the damage is based on the current
         or maximum values of HP and/or MP.  These attacks include
         the Bomb's 'Self-Destruct', the MAGIC SWORD attack 'Shock!',
         the Byblos' 'Shock', and the Archaic Demon's 'Lifebreak',
         among others.

     (2) The DRAW OUT attack Murasame, which restores (Caster's MA * 12) HP
         to all targets, regardless of Zodiac compatibility.  This is 
         probably a programming oversight.

In general, the better the compatibility, the higher the damage or the success 
rate of attacks exchanged between two units.

O: Neutral

In terms of Zodiac compatibility, attacks fall into two major classes:  those
with variable damage, and those with variable success rate.  'Variable damage'
is here defined as damage that is influenced by any of the caster's statistics
EXCEPT for HP or MP.  'Variable success rate' means that some statistic of the
caster can influence the success rate of the attack.

 VARIABLE DAMAGE
 ---------------
 In general, damaging attacks will have one stat (or two; see below) that
 influence the magnitude of the damage.  If we call the relevant stat XA,
 Zodiac compatibility modifies the XA as follows:

 'Neutral' compatibility:  XA_zodiac = XA
 'Good' compatibility:     XA_zodiac = XA + [XA / 4]
 'Best' compatibility:     XA_zodiac = XA + [XA / 2]
 'Bad' compatibility:      XA_zodiac = XA - [XA / 4]
 'Worst' compatibility:    XA_zodiac = XA - [XA / 2]

  Once you have calculated XA_zodiac, use XA_zodiac instead of the original
  XA in calculating the damage or success rate of an attack.


 VARIABLE SUCCESS RATE
 ---------------------
 Instead of affecting only the attack stat, Zodiac compatibility is usually
 applied to the success rate as a whole:

 'Neutral' compatibility:  success%_zodiac = success%
 'Good' compatibility:     success%_zodiac = success% + [success% / 4]
 'Best' compatibility:     success%_zodiac = success% + [success% / 2]
 'Bad' compatibility:      success%_zodiac = success% - [success% / 4]
 'Worst' compatibility:    success%_zodiac = success% - [success% / 2]

 TALK SKILL provides a good example of this -- say you have a Mediator
 with an MA of 21.  The success rate of 'Death Sentence' against a neutral
 target would be (MA + 30) = 51%.  Against a target with good compatibility,
 success is 51 + [51/4] = 51 + 12 = 63%.  Applying the zodiac just to the MA
 would give you ((21 + [21/4]) + 30) = 26 + 30 = 56%, which is wrong.

 Variable success rate attacks are often subject to evasion as well.  An 
 important thing to keep in mind is that ZODIAC COMPATIBILITY DOES NOT 
 AFFECT EVASION; it can only affect the base success percentage of an 
 attack.

Since monsters are unisex, they are immune from 'Best' and 'Worst'.  So,
for a monster, any unit that would normally be 'Best' or 'Worst' is instead
'Bad'.  NOTE -- some of the Lucavi beasts actually have their sex bit set
to MALE or FEMALE and thus are not monsters even though they appear to be.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[1.4] evasion 
      =========================================================================

When you attack a unit, it has a chance to dodge your attack with four 
parameters: (1) its natural stealth (C-EV); (2) its shield (S-EV); (3) 
its accessory (A-EV); (4) its weapon (W-EV), if it has the reaction 
ability 'Weapon Guard' set.  There are separate categories for physical 
(P.SEV, P.AEV, P.CEV) and magical (M.SEV, M.AEV, M.CEV) evade.  Weapon 
evasion only works on physical attacks, and for the purpose of these
equations, W.EV = 0 unless the evading unit has 'Weapon Guard'.


EVADING PHYSICAL ATTACKS
------------------------

Physical attack evasion depends on the attacker's position relative to
the target.  These equations will produce a percentage from 0 to 100.

from front:  
hit% = [(base hit%)*(100-P.CEV)*(100-P.SEV)*(100-P.AEV)*(100-W.EV) / (10^8)]

from side:   
hit% = [(base hit%) * (100-P.SEV) * (100-P.AEV) * (100-W.EV) / (10^6)]

from rear:   
hit% = [(base hit%) * (100-P.AEV) / 100]

The above equations were designed with the constraints of FFT's math system
in mind.  Since we are capable of noninteger division, it may be easier to
remove the final division by the large power of 10, and to think of each 
factor of (100 - P.xEV) as equivalent to (1 - P.xEV/100), in decimal
form.

- To determine whether an attack is subject to evade, check out the information
  for the attack in question in Part 2 or 3 of this guide.

- For normal weapon attacks, THROW, sword skills, Spin Fist, Repeating Fist, 
  Wave Fist, Earth Slash, Throw Stone, and Dash, the base hit% is 100.  For
  other attacks, see the appropriate section of Part 2 or 3 for how to 
  determine the base hit%.

- Even if you fire BATTLE SKILL attacks out of a gun, they are still subject
  to evasion.

- MIGHTY SWORD has a 00% success rate if the target is not equipped with an 
  appropriate item for the Mighty Sword skill to break.  Consequently, all 
  monsters are unaffected by MIGHTY SWORD.

- What is considered the 'front', 'side', and 'back' can be confusing when
  dealing with ranged attacks like arrows and Wave Fist.  The following 
  diagram should help (thanks to Notti for giving me the idea to present 
  the information in this way).

 ___________________ 
|   |   |   |   |   |   If the target is standing on the panel marked 'X'   
| S | B | B | B | S |   and facing in the direction indicated by the arrow,
|___|___|___|___|___|   if you are attacking from a panel marked 'F', you
|   |   |   |   |   |   are considered to be attacking from the front; if
| S | S | B | S | S |   you attack from a panel marked 'S', the game
|___|___|___|___|___|   considers you to be attacking from the side; and
|   |   |  ||   |   |   if you attack from a panel marked 'B', you are
| S | S | Xv| S | S |   attacking from the rear.  Basically, the game
|___|___|___|___|___|   just decides whether your forward, sideways, or
|   |   |   |   |   |   behind distance from your opponent is greater, and
| S | F | F | F | S |   takes that to be your orientation.  In the event
|___|___|___|___|___|   of a tie, the foremost direction is the winner 
|   |   |   |   |   |   (front over side, side over back).  Note that this
| F | F | F | F | F |   is absolutely independent of the relative panel
|___|___|___|___|___|   heights.


EVADING MAGICAL ATTACKS
-----------------------

any position:  hit% = [(base hit%) * (100 - M.SEV) * (100 - M.AEV) / 10000]

This applies to most magic attacks, whether they be status-inducing 
or damage-causing. 

- A unit will not try to evade attacks that are curative or that
  add helpful status. See the relevant section of Part 3 to determine
  whether a magic attack is subject to evade.

For an example of how evade percentages work (using the simplified 
versions of the equations that involve noninteger division), let's say 
Ramza attacks Algus -- who is equipped with a Crystal Shield (P.SEV +40%, 
M.SEV +15%) and a Feather Mantle (P.AEV +40%, M.AEV +30%) -- from the side. 
Inherent evade% (P.CEV) is ineffective from the side, but Algus' shield 
(P.SEV) and cloak (P.AEV) will give him a chance to avoid the damage:

               Orig%   Shield    Mantle
Ramza's Hit% = [100 * (1-.40) * (1-.40)] = [100 * .6 * .6] = 36%.

And if Ramza now decides to cast 'Flare' on Algus, Algus is also 
considerably protected due to M.SEV and M.AEV:

                     Shield    Mantle
Flare Hit% = [100 * (1-.15) * (1-.30)] = [100 * .85 * .7] = [.595] = 59%

Note that the inherent magical evade percent (M.CEV) stat is useless,
as it is 0% for all classes.  We will therefore ignore it for the
rest of this guide.

If a target is somehow protected from a particular attack
(for instance, if he has Rubber Shoes [cancel: Lightning] equipped and is
targeted with Bolt 3, or is targeted with Seal Evil and is not undead), that 
attack will have a 00% success rate, regardless of zodiac sign, evasion 
multipliers, percentage multipliers, or anything else.

The reaction ability 'Abandon' causes all of a unit's evasion percentages
to be doubled for the entire battle (it does not require a trigger, despite
what the in-game description says).  The 'Defending' status causes the same
effect temporarily.

If a target evades an attack due to its C-Ev, a 'Missed!' message will be
displayed.  If a target evades an attack due to its A-Ev or S-Ev, a
'Guarded' message will be displayed.

As mentioned in the Zodiac section above, Zodiac compatibility has NO effect 
on evasion percentages.

For a list of S-Ev values for each shield, see section B.2. For a list of A-Ev
values for each mantle, see B.3.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[1.5] protect and shell
      =========================================================================

The 'Protect' and 'Shell' statuses can protect units from several attacks
in a variety of ways.  Here is a summary of the different types of defense
afforded by these statuses.

- If a physical attack does damage and the target has Protect, the attack stat
  (XA) in the damage equation will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3].
  If a physical attack inflicts a status, the XA in the success rate equation
  will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3].  If a physical attack
  causes damage calculated from the max or current HP of the target (e.g., 
  Mutilate), Protect will only affect the success rate of the attack, and
  not the damage.

- If a magical attack does damage and the target has shell, the attack stat
  (XA) in the damage equation will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3].
  If a magical attack inflicts a status, the XA in the success rate equation
  will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3].  If a magical attack
  causes damage calculated from the max or current HP/MP of the target (e.g.,
  Demi, Demi 2, Life Drain, Spell Absorb, Gravi2, Lich), Shell will only
  affect the success rate of the attack, and not the damage.

Unlike Zodiac compatibility, Protect and Shell ONLY affect the XA for
variable success rate attacks -- not the entire percentage.  Consequently,
with the exception of some (MA+K)%-based attacks of high-level monsters, 
Protect and Shell's effect on success rates of attacks is far less signficant 
than the effect of Zodiac compatibility.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[1.6] the elements
      =========================================================================

There are eight elemental properties in the game: Fire, Ice, Lightning, 
Water, Earth, Wind, Dark, and Holy.

In turn, there are two separate effects that can be caused by an elemental
attribute.  They are (1) MA strengthening for a caster, and (2) damage 
modification for a target.

If the caster of an elemental spell has equipment endowed with 'Strengthen:
(element)', when he casts spells of that element, his strengthened_MA will
be equal to [MA * 5/4].  Note that this applies to the MA of the caster,
and not to the damage caused by the spell.  Though this will increase the 
damage of most spells (e.g., Fire 4, Shiva, Holy), if the spell normally does 
damage that is independent of MA (e.g., Lich), it will do no more damage 
from the 'Strengthen' effect (the success percentage, however, which does 
depend on MA, will be increased).  The 'Strengthen' bonus works the same for 
elemental weapons like Ice Brand and Holy Lance, except it is applied to
the appropriate attack stat(s) of the weapon.

The target of an elemental spell can have a variety of properties that
modify the actual DAMAGE dealt by the spells on that target (and not
the caster's MA):

'Weak: (Element)'  ... Damage from this element is doubled, even when
                       the amount of damage is unaffected by other types
                       of modifiers.  This doubling takes the form of an
                       extra factor of two in the damage equation, inserted
                       just before the final rounding (e.g., Tiamats receive 
                       RU{(MaxHP*68)/100} damage from Hurricane instead of 
                       RU{(MaxHP*34)/100} because they are weak against Wind).
                 
'Half: (Element)'  ... Damage from this element is halved (and truncated).
                       As with 'Weak', this applies even to attacks not
                       normally susceptible to damage modification, and
                       the factor of 1/2 is inserted just before the final
                       rounding. 

'Cancel: (Element)' .. Attacks of this element cannot succeed (the 
                       prediction will just say 00%)

'Absorb: (Element)' .. Damage from element is added to, instead of 
                       subtracted from, the HP total.

Note that Weak, Half, Absorb and Cancel have no effect on the success
rate of elemental attacks.

For Geomancy, only MA is affected by elemental attributes, even
though PA is also used to calculate the damage.

The elemental affiliations of an attack are listed in its description 
(press SELECT), and also in the big list in section 3.3.

Example of elemental effects:

This example allows you to appreciate the subtle difference between the 
two kinds of elemental effects.  Let's assume you have a Summoner with
20 MA and 70 Fa casting Lich on a target with 501 Max HP, neutral Zodiac 
compability and 60 Fa.  Lich does damage equal to RU{Target's MaxHP/2} 
with a success rate of [(Caster Fa)*(Target Fa)*(MA+160) / 10000].  
Now envision some scenarios:

1.  Normal.  Lich does RU{501/2} = 251 damage with a success rate of
    [70*60*180/10000] = 75%.

2.  The Summoner equips himself with 108 Gems, which strengthens Dark
    elemental.  This means that wherever MA is considered, 
    new_MA = [MA * 5/4].  Because MA doesn't determine the damage done
    by Lich, the damage is unaffected, and remains at 251.  The success
    rate, however, increases slightly, because new_MA = [20 * 5/4] = 25.
    So the success rate is now [70*60*185/10000] = 77%.

3.  Suppose the Summoner unequips the Gems, then the target equips himself 
    with an N-Kai Armlet, which has the property 'Half: Dark'.  Since 
    'Half' affects damage itself and NOT MA directly, this time the damage 
    done by the spell will be affected, but the success rate will not. The 
    damage will now be equal to RU{MaxHP/4}, or 126.  The success rate, 
    however, remains unaffected at 75%.

Weather-related effects on magic -- such as the strengthening of Lightning
during thunderstorms, the weakening of Fire during thunderstorms, and the
strengthening of Ice during snowstorms (see 5.5) -- are effects of the 
second type, influencing the actual damage done by the spell rather than 
the caster's MA.

Certain attacks -- such as ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL and HOLY SWORD 
directives -- are weapon-elemental, meaning they acquire the elemental 
properties of the weapon the caster is equipped with. If the caster's weapon 
has no elemental affiliation, weapon-elemental attacks will be non-elemental. 
In addition, physical attacks that are weapon-elemental only receive a bonus
from the 'Martial Arts' ability if the caster is barehanded.

CRITICAL HITS
-------------

Approximately 5% of the time, the ATTACK command will deliver
a critical hit. The sound of the hit will be more sharp and 
sudden, and the damage numbers will be animated slightly
differently.

Critical hits randomly modify the ATTACKing unit's PA, MA, 
and/or Speed (depending on what weapon the unit is equipped with) 
to increase damage.  This modified PA, MA, or Speed is then 
plugged into the appropriate formula above to calculate the final 
damage.

Critical hit bonus:

modified_XA = normal_XA + (1..normal_XA) - 1

This equation is equivalent to

modified_XA = normal_XA + (0..(normal_XA-1))

but I suspect that it is the first equation that FFT actually uses,
given that in other cases it generates random numbers of the form
(1..x) rather than (0..x).  However, I don't know for sure.

Regardless, the max damage a critical hit can do is equal to
((2 * normal_XA) - 1) * WP -- slightly less than twice normal
damage -- and the least it can do is normal damage.  Most often it 
will be between these two extrema.

Critical hits will also knock the target back one square
fifty percent of the time (assuming that there is an unoccupied
square directly behind the target).


DAMAGE MODIFIERS
----------------

Many factors -- including the attacker's abilities and status, the
target's abilities and status, as well as Zodiac compatibility -- can
affect the damage done by weapon attacks.  The procedure outlined below
is a summary of how to apply all these different modifiers.

'XA' below stands for whatever expression that the weapon multiplies by
Weapon Power to get the final damage.  For example, XA = PA for swords,
XA = [(PA + Sp) / 2] for longbows, and XA = WP for physical guns.

If there are multiple instances of the _same_ statistic in a damage
equation (for instance, the non-magic gun and barehand equations), only
modify _one_ instance of the statistic.  See section 1.7 for a 
clarification on this.

Let 'XA0' be the attacker's XA on the stat screen.  The 'Attacker' is the 
unit making the attack, and the 'Defender' is the unit being attacked.

   1. If this is a critical hit, then XA1 = XA0 + (1..XA0) - 1.  See 
      section 2.1 for details.
   2. If the weapon is endowed with an Element, and the attacker has
      equipment that 'Strengthens' that element, then (XA2 = [XA1 * 5/4]),
      else XA2 = XA1
   3. If attacker has Attack UP, then (XA3 = [XA2 * 4/3]), else XA3 = XA2
   4. If attacker has Martial Arts and is barehanded, then 
      (XA4 = [XA3 * 3/2]), else XA4 = XA3
   5. If attacker is Berserk, then (XA5 = [XA4 * 3/2]), else XA5 = XA4
   6. If defender has Defense UP, then (XA6 = [XA5 * 2/3]), else XA6 = XA5
   7. If defender has Protect, then (XA7 = [XA6 * 2/3]), else XA7 = XA6
   8. If defender is Charging, then (XA8 = [XA7 * 3/2]), else XA8 = XA7
   9. If defender is Sleeping, then (XA9 = [XA8 * 3/2]), else XA9 = XA8
  10. If defender is a Chicken and/or a Frog, then (XA10 = [XA9 * 3/2]), 
      else XA10 = XA9
  11. Apply zodiac multipliers:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/4]))
          elseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/4])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/2])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/2])
          else XA11 = XA10
  12. Apply weapon's damage formula using XA = XA11 (if there is more
      than one instance of XA, only set _one_ instance to XA11 and
      leave the other as XA0 (see above).

Also remember that weapon attacks can be evaded.  See section 1.3 for
details.        


______________________________________________________________________________
[2.2] charge
      ========================================================================

Damage from the Archer's CHARGE command is calculated using the
normal weapon equations, with the following modifications.

For Charge +K, damage is equal to:

Bare Hands: [((PA + K) * Br) / 100] * PA
Knife: [((PA + K) + (Spd + K)) / 2] * WP
Sword: (PA + K) * WP
Knight Sword: [((PA + K) * Br) / 100] * WP
Ninja Sword: [((PA + K) + (Sp + K)) / 2] * WP
Katana: [((PA + K) * Br) / 100] * WP
Staff: (MA + K) * WP
Rod: (PA + K) * WP
Crossbow: (PA + K) * WP
Bow: [((PA + K) + (Spd + K)) / 2] * WP  
Gun (standard): (WP + K) * WP
Gun (magic): [CFa/100 * TFa/100 * (WP + K) * Q]
Flail: F * WP | F = (1..(PA + K))
Axe: F * WP | F = (1..(PA + K))
Stick: (MA + K) * WP  
Spear: (PA + K) * WP  
Musical Instrument: [(PA+K + MA+K) / 2] * WP (range 3)
Dictionary: [(PA+K + MA+K) / 2] * WP (range 3)
Cloth: [(PA+K + MA+K) / 2] * WP (range 2)
Bag: F * WP | F = (1..(PA + K))

CHARGE abilities are slow actions and have the following 
initial values of ctr:

ATTACK NAME    INITIAL CTR
-----------   -------------
Charge +1 ...  4 clockticks 
Charge +2 ...  5 clockticks
Charge +3 ...  6 clockticks
Charge +4 ...  8 clockticks
Charge +5 ... 10 clockticks
Charge +7 ... 14 clockticks
Charge +10... 20 clockticks
Charge +20... 35 clockticks

These ctr values are not affected by the 'Short Charge' or 'Non-charge' 
abilities.

A CHARGE directive can only target a panel, not a unit.  If the target of 
the CHARGE moves before the CHARGE is executed, the attack will fail to 
connect.

If the caster of the CHARGE moves while charging or if his weapon is broken
while he is charging, the CHARGE will be aborted. (Exception: The undead
Archer's version of CHARGE does not have the latter restriction. If the
charging unit's weapon is broken, the CHARGE will continue and will resolve
as a fist attack, even if the original weapon was a long-distance weapon.)

In terms of damage, evasion, and modifiers, CHARGE attacks are treated
just like normal weapon attacks (see section 2.1 for details). CHARGE attacks
are weapon-elemental.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[2.3] jump
      =========================================================================

Damage from a JUMP is calculated as follows:

   If caster is equipped with any weapon, then

                            damage = (PA * K) * WP         
   
   If caster is barehanded, then
                  
                       damage = [(PA * Br) / 100] * PA    

   where K = 3/2 if the jumping character is equipped with a spear
         K = 1 otherwise

The JUMP directive will leave the jumper in the air for a number
of clockticks, ctr:

                        ctr = [50 / (Jumper's Speed)] 

This ctr value is unaffected by the 'Short Charge' and 'Non-Charge'
abilities.  Haste status is ignored in this equation -- a Hasted
jumper will land in the same number of clockticks as an un-Hasted 
jumper with the same Speed. 

While JUMP is charging, the jumper cannot be a target. A jumper's 
CT will still increase while he is in the air, although the counters 
on time-dependent status effects will pause. Normal jumpers will land 
with ~50 CT; Hasted jumpers will land with ~75 CT.

Range of the jump is determined by the specific Lancer abilities
that the jumper has learned:

range/effect = XvY/1

where X = 1 if no Level Jump abilities have been learned
      X = 2 if Level Jump2 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      X = 3 if Level Jump3 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      X = 4 if Level Jump4 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      X = 5 if Level Jump5 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      .
      .
      .
      X = 8 if Level Jump8 is the highest Level Jump ability learned

and   Y = 1 if no Vertical Jump abilities have been learned
      Y = 2 if Vertical Jump2 is the highest Vertical Jump ability learned
      Y = 3 if Vertical Jump3 is the highest Vertical Jump ability learned
      .
      .
      .
      Y = 8 if Vertical Jump8 is the highest Vertical Jump ability learned

The JP cost of these abilities is as follows:

      Level Jump2 ... 150 JP          Vertical Jump2 ... 100 JP
      Level Jump3 ... 300 JP          Vertical Jump3 ... 200 JP
      Level Jump4 ... 450 JP          Vertical Jump4 ... 300 JP
      Level Jump5 ... 600 JP          Vertical Jump5 ... 400 JP
      Level Jump8 ... 900 JP          Vertical Jump6 ... 500 JP
                                      Vertical Jump7 ... 600 JP
                                      Vertical Jump8 ... 900 JP

JUMP damage is subject to several modifiers.  Let PA0 be the jumper's PA as 
displayed on the status screen.

 1. If target has Defense UP, then (PA1 = [PA0 * 2/3]), else PA1 = PA0
 2. If target has Protect, then (PA2 = [PA1 * 2/3]), else PA2 = PA1
 3. If target is Charging, then (PA3 = [PA2 * 3/2]), else PA3 = PA2
 4. If target is Sleeping, then (PA4 = [PA3 * 3/2]), else PA4 = PA3
 5. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (PA5 = [PA4 * 3/2]), else 
    PA5 = PA4
 6. If caster is equipped with a spear, then (PA6 = [PA5 * 3/2]), else
    PA6 = PA5
 7. Factor in zodiac compatibility:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (PA7 = PA6 + [(PA6)/4]))
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (PA7 = PA6 - [(PA6)/4])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (PA7 = PA6 + [(PA6)/2])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (PA7 = PA6 - [(PA6)/2])
          Else PA7 = PA6
 7. Damage = PA7 * WP (armed) or damage = PA7 * [PA0 * Br/100] (unarmed)

Miscellaneous properties of JUMP:

> Physical attack
> Weapon-elemental
> Cannot be Reflected
> Cannot be evaded
> Triggers Countergrasp reactions
> Triggers Counter Flood
> Does not trigger Counter Magic 
> Affected by Protect and Defense UP
> NOT affected by Attack UP or Martial Arts
> Can only target panels, not specific units
> The (PA * WP) component of the damage formula remains the same regardless 
  of the weapon equipped -- even if that weapon does not use this formula 
  to calculate its ATTACK damage (e.g. staves, dictionaries, knives, guns).
> Jump +X and Ignore Height have NO effect on the JUMP command -- these 
  abilities influence the Jump statistic, which is completely different
  from the JUMP action ability.

[2.4] throw
      =========================================================================

THROW damage is calculated by the following equation.

                    damage = (Caster_Speed * ThrownWeaponPower)

'ThrownWeaponPower' is the WP of the thrown weapon (see Appendix B for a list 
of Weapon Powers).

The range and effect of THROW are M/1 (line of sight), where M is equal to 
your 'Move' statistic.

In order to THROW a weapon, you must learn the Ninja ability corresponding 
to that weapon's type.  These abilities are as follows:

   Shuriken .........  50 JP; allows the unit to THROW shuriken
   Ball .............  70 JP; allows the unit to THROW bombs
   Knife ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW daggers
   Sword ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW regular swords
   Hammer ........... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW flails
   Katana ........... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW katana
   Ninja Sword ...... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW ninja swords
   Axe .............. 120 JP; allows the unit to THROW axes
   Spear ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW spears
   Stick ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW sticks
   Knight Sword ..... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW knight swords
   Dictionary ....... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW dictionaries

MODIFIERS

THROW is a physical attack, but oddly enough it is not affected by Attack UP.
Below is a summary of the different multipliers that may be applied to it.

The 'thrower' is the unit throwing the weapon, and the 'target' is the unit 
being attacked. Let 'Sp0' be the thrower's initial Speed, given on the 
status screen. 
 
 1. If target has Defense UP, then (Sp1 = [Sp0 * 2/3]), else Sp1 = Sp0
 2. If target has Protect, then (Sp2 = [Sp1 * 2/3]), else Sp2 = Sp1
 3. If target is Charging, then (Sp3 = [Sp2 * 3/2]), else Sp3 = Sp2
 4. If target is Sleeping, then (Sp4 = [Sp3 * 3/2]), else Sp4 = Sp3
 5. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (Sp5 = [Sp4 * 3/2]), else 
    Sp5 = Sp4

          If compatibility is 'Good', then (Sp6 = Sp5 + [(Sp5)/4]))
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (Sp6 = Sp5 - [(Sp5)/4])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (Sp6 = Sp5 + [(Sp5)/2])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (Sp6 = Sp5 - [(Sp5)/2])
          Else Sp6 = Sp5
 7. Damage = Sp6 * (ThrownWpnPwr)

Evasion for THROW attacks works the same as it does for normal weapon
attacks (see 1.4).

Miscellaneous properties of THROW:

> Physical attack
> Acquires the elemental of the thrown weapon
> Cannot be Reflected
> Can be evaded
> Triggers Countergrasp reactions
> Triggers Counter Flood
> Triggers Catch: If Catch succeeds, the THROW directive is aborted,
  a 'Caught' message is displayed, and the thrown weapon is added to
  the catcher's inventory.
> Does not trigger Counter Magic
> Affected by Protect and Defense UP
> NOT affected by Attack UP

[2.5] item 
      =========================================================================

The Chemist's ITEM command allows a unit to use various curative items
in battle.  In order to use an ITEM ability, you must have at least one
of the appropriate item in your inventory; each time you use an ITEM
command, your stock of that item will be depleted by 1.

The range and effect of ITEM are 4/1 (line of sight) if the item-user has 
the 'Throw Item' support ability (this includes all Chemists, which have 
'Throw Item' inherently), and 1/1 otherwise.

Here is a list of all usable items, their effects, their costs in gil, and 
the JP cost to learn the Chemist ability that allows you to use them in 
battle.

[2.7] math skill
      =========================================================================

The MATH SKILL command, one of the game's most exploitable, allows you to cast
various magic spells on many targets, instantly and without MP cost.  Upon
choosing MATH SKILL, you will be presented with three menus that you will use
to set the parameters that govern the MATH SKILL attack.

First menu:  Here you set the criterion that will determine who the spell
             targets.  The more Calculator JP you spend, the more options
             will appear here:

             CT           250 JP    Target based on units' CT
             Level        350 JP    Target based on units' Level
             Height       200 JP    Target based on units' height

Second menu: Here you define the numerical properties of the MATH SKILL.

             Prime Number 300 JP    Targets prime integers
             5            200 JP    Targets integer multiples of 5
             4            400 JP    Targets integer multiples of 4
             3            600 JP    Targets integer multiples of 3

             By 'integer multiple of n', I mean any integer Z such that

             n * j = Z

             for some integer j, j > 0.

Third menu:  Here you select the spell you want to use.  These are all marked
             as "CALC: +" in section 3.3, and are listed below.

             Cure       Wall       Ice        Stop            Zombie
             Cure 2     Esuna      Ice 2      Don't Move      Silence Song
             Cure 3     Holy       Ice 3      Float           Blind Rage
             Raise      Fire       Poison     Reflect         Foxbird
             Raise 2    Fire 2     Frog       Demi            Confusion Song
             Reraise    Fire 3     Death      Demi 2          Dispel Magic
             Regen      Bolt       Flare      Blind           Paralyze
             Protect    Bolt 2     Haste      Pray Faith      Sleep
             Shell      Bolt 3     Slow       Doubt Faith     Petrify

The MATH SKILL will then be cast, using the parameters you selected from the
first, second and third menus.  The spell will not cost any MP, and will be
executed instantly.  Damage formulas, success rates, and evade percentages
work exactly as if the spell had been cast by normal means.

_______________________________________________________________________________
[3.1] legend
      =========================================================================

What follows is a chart containing detailed information on the 356 action
abilities in FFT that were not covered in Part 2. In this section is a key 
to the abbreviations that appear in the chart.

[ xxx ] .....  The number between brackets at the top-center of each box is the
               index number for this attack, in hexadecimal.  Attacks with an
               index number less than or equal to 095 can be Mimicked; those
               with an index number of 096 or greater cannot.

The words in ALL CAPS in the upper-right-hand corner are the command set
from which the attack originates.  Some attacks are found in more than one
command set; for these, only one set is listed.

physical .... This attack meets at least one of the three following criteria:
              (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
                  having 'Attack UP'
              (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
                  having 'Defense UP' or 'Protect' status
              (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's physical evade.
              If a physical attack does not meet one or two of these criteria, 
              it will be noted in the attack description (or as EVD: -).

magical ..... This attack meets at least one of the three following criteria:
              (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
                  having 'Magic AttackUP'
              (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
                  having 'Magic DefendUP' or 'Shell' status.
              (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's magical evade.
              Most magical attacks meet more than one of these criteria; 
              if an attack does not meet one of them, it will be noted in 
              the attack description (or as EVD: -). (In general, magical 
              attacks that have beneficial effects, such as Cure and Protect,
              are not susceptible to 'Shell', 'Magic DefendUP', or magic 
              evade.)

neutral ..... This attack is neither physical nor magical.

REFL ........ + This attack is redirected if target has 'Reflect' status.
              - This attack is unaffected by 'Reflect'.

CALC ........ + This attack can be used with MATH SKILL.
              - This attack cannot be used with MATH SKILL.

ELEM ........ Indicates the attack's elemental affiliation. See section 1.6 
              for more information.
              F = Fire       A = Wind (Air)  H = Holy
              I = Ice        W = Water       D = Dark
              L = Lightning  E = Earth     wpn = Weapon-elemental
              Weapon-elemental (wpn) attacks use the elemental property
              of whatever weapon the caster is equipped with (if the caster
              has two weapons, the weapon equipped in the top hand takes 
              precedence). In addition, weapon-elemental attacks are not 
              subject to any bonus from 'Martial Arts'.              
              
MOD ......... Indicates the type of damage or success rate modifiers that
              apply to this attack. See section 3.2 for details.

CBG ......... + This attack activates Countergrasp reactions (see 6.1)
              - This attack does not activate Countergrasp reactions

CM .......... + This attack activates 'Counter Magic' (see 6.1)
              - This attack does not activate 'Counter Magic'

CF .......... + This attack activates 'Counter Flood' (see 6.1)
              - This attack does not activate 'Counter Flood'

EVD ......... + This attack is subject to evade (physical if it is a physical
                attack, magical if it is a magical attack)
              - This attack is not subject to evade

MP .......... Amount of Magic Points required to use this attack

CTR ......... Number of clockticks that must elapse before the attack resolves.
              If CTR = 0, the attack is a fast-action. If CTR > 0, the caster 
              will be inflicted with 'Charging' status until the attack 
              resolves or until the caster cancels 'Charging' by selecting 
              another command during another AT.  Exception: if the attack is
              a SING or DANCE attack, 'Performing' will be inflicted on the 
              caster instead of 'Charging'. 'Performing' will not be cancelled
              unless the caster chooses another command from the AT menu on a
              subsequent AT; barring this, the SING or DANCE attack will 
              continue to be executed every Nth clocktick, where N = CTR.

JP .......... Job Points required to purchase this ability

MATHEMATICAL SYMBOLS
--------------------

[x / y]      Divide x by y and take only the integer part of the quotient,
             discarding the remainder.  For example, [12 / 4] = 3,
             [13 / 4] = 3, [-14 / 4] = -3, [15 / 4] = 3, [16 / 4] = 4.

RU{x / y}    This is defined as [(x + y - 1) / y].  Intuitively, you can
             think of it as dividing and, if there is a nonzero remainder,
             rounding up to the nearest integer.

(x..y)       The game generates a random integer between x and y,
             inclusive.

OTHER ABBREVIATIONS
-------------------

Critical hit 
possible .......... This attack has the potential to cause a critical hit.
                    Critical hits will occur ~5% of the time. To calculate
                    critical hit damage, see the procedure in section 3.2
                    under "MOD: 2".

Drain ............. Damage from this attack is subtracted from the target's
                    current HP or MP and then added to the caster's current
                    HP or MP.

Undead reversal ... If the target of this attack is Undead, then any damage
                    done to that target will instead heal the target by an
                    amount equal to the putative damage. In addition, if
                    the target of this attack is Undead, any healing done
                    to that target will instead damage the target; the
                    damage will be equal in magnitude to the putative
                    healing.

C_x ............... "Caster's x" -- for example, "C_MaxHP" means caster's 
                    maximum HP.

T_x ............... "Target's x" -- for example, "T_MaxHP" means target's 
                    maximum HP.

LOS ............... Target must lie along caster's line of sight in order
                    for this attack to hit; if another unit intervenes on
                    this line between caster and target, the other unit
                    will suffer the effect of the spell instead of the
                    target.

CI ................ Caster immune. If placed after the Range number, this
                    means that the caster cannot target himself with this
                    attack. If placed after the Effect number, this means
                    that if even if the caster is within the effect area
                    of this attack, the attack will not hit him. If an
                    attack is CI in Range, it will always be CI in Effect,
                    but this will not be explicitly listed.

4 directions ...... Range extends linearly in four directions: in front of
                    caster, behind caster, and to both sides of caster.

3 directions ...... Effect area extends linearly in three directions: in
                    front of caster and to both sides of caster.

MaxHP ............. Maximum HP
CurrentHP ......... HP currently remaining
MaxMP ............. Maximum MP
CurrentMP ......... MP currently remaining
Sp ................ Speed
PA ................ Physical attack power
MA ................ Magical attack power
Br ................ Brave
CFa ............... Caster's Faith
TFa ............... Target's Faith


_______________________________________________________________________________
[3.2] damage and success rate modifiers
      =========================================================================

The attacks of FFT fall into several categories of damage & success modifiers.
In the list below, they will be classified into 6 different types.

To quickly jump back to these descriptions, Search for "[MOD: n]" (without the
quotes), where n is the MOD value for the attack you're interested in.


[MOD: 0] ~ immutable
--------------------
The damage or success rate of these attacks is subject to no modifications --
it is not even affected by Zodiac compatibility.


[MOD: 1] ~ zodiac only
----------------------
The damage or success rate of these attacks is affected only by Zodiac
compatibility -- nothing else.


[MOD: 2] ~ physical attacks : damage variable
---------------------------------------------
'XA' below stands for the relevant attack stat for the attack in question.

If there are multiple instances of the _same_ statistic in a damage
equation, only modify _one_ instance of the statistic.  See section 1.7 
for a clarification on this.

Let 'XA0' be the attacker's XA on the stat screen.  The 'Attacker' is the 
unit making the attack, and the 'Defender' is the unit being attacked.

   1. If this is a critical hit, then XA1 = XA0 + (1..XA0) - 1.  
   2. If the attack is endowed with an Element, and the attacker has
      equipment that 'Strengthens' that element, then (XA2 = [XA1 * 5/4]),
      else XA2 = XA1
   3. If attacker has Attack UP, then (XA3 = [XA2 * 4/3]), else XA3 = XA2
   4. If attacker has Martial Arts AND this is not a wpn-elemental attack,
      then (XA4 = [XA3 * 3/2]), else XA4 = XA3
   5. If attacker is Berserk, then (XA5 = [XA4 * 3/2]), else XA5 = XA4
   6. If defender has Defense UP, then (XA6 = [XA5 * 2/3]), else XA6 = XA5
   7. If defender has Protect, then (XA7 = [XA6 * 2/3]), else XA7 = XA6
   8. If defender is Charging, then (XA8 = [XA7 * 3/2]), else XA8 = XA7
   9. If defender is Sleeping, then (XA9 = [XA8 * 3/2]), else XA9 = XA8
  10. If defender is a Chicken and/or a Frog, then (XA10 = [XA9 * 3/2]), 
      else XA10 = XA9
  11. Apply zodiac multipliers:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/4]))
          elseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/4])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/2])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/2])
          else XA11 = XA10
  12. Apply damage formula using XA = XA11 (if there is more than one 
      instance of XA, only set _one_ instance to XA11 and leave the other 
      as XA0 (see above).


[MOD: 3] ~ physical attacks : success rate variable
---------------------------------------------------

 1. If caster has Attack UP, then (XA1 = [XA0 * 4/3]), else XA1 = XA0
 2. If caster has Martial Arts and is bare-handed, then 
    (XA2 = [XA1 * 3/2]), else XA2 = XA1
 3. If target has Defense UP, then (XA3 = [XA2 * 2/3]), else XA3 = XA2
 4. If target has Protect, then (XA4 = [XA3 * 2/3]), else XA4 = XA3
 5. If target is Charging, then (XA5 = [XA4 * 3/2]), else XA5 = XA4
 6. If target is Sleeping, then (XA6 = [XA5 * 3/2]), else XA6 = XA5
 7. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (XA7 = [XA6 * 3/2]), else 
    XA7 = XA6
 8. Calculate Z (zodiac addend):
      If compatibility is 'Good', then Z = [(XA7 + K) / 4]
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then Z = -[(XA7 + K) / 4]
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then Z = [(XA7 + K) / 2]
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then Z = -[(XA7 + K) / 2]
      Else Z = 0
    XA8 = XA7 + Z
 9. Apply success rate formula using XA8.
10. Consider physical evasion multipliers, if applicable.

Note that elementals have no effect on MOD 3 attacks.

[MOD: 4] ~ steal
----------------

Attacks of this type are all STEAL directives.  The 'caster' is the unit 
executing the STEAL directive, and the 'target' is the unit being stolen 
from.  Let 'Sp0' be the caster's original Speed as given on the status 
screen.

   1. If caster has Attack UP, then (Sp1 = [Sp0 * 4/3]), else Sp1 = Sp0
   2. If caster has Martial Arts, then (Sp2 = [Sp1 * 3/2]), else Sp2 = Sp1
   3. If target has Defense UP, then (Sp3 = [Sp2 * 2/3]), else Sp3 = Sp2
   4. If target has Protect, then (Sp4 = [Sp3 * 2/3]), else Sp4 = Sp3
   5. If target is Charging, then (Sp5 = [Sp4 * 3/2]), else Sp5 = Sp4
   6. If target is Sleeping, then (Sp6 = [Sp5 * 3/2]), else Sp6 = Sp5
   7. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (Sp7 = [Sp6 * 3/2]), else 
      Sp7 = Sp6
   8. Calculate Z (zodiac addend):
        If compatibility is 'Good', then Z = [(Sp7 + K)/4]  
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then Z = -[(Sp7 + K)/4]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then Z = [(Sp7 + K)/2]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then Z = -[(Sp7 + K)/2]
        Else Z = 0
      Sp8 = Sp7 + Z
   9. Success% = (Sp8 + K)
  10. Consider physical evasion multipliers, if applicable.


[MOD: 5] ~ magical attacks : damage variable
--------------------------------------------

Let MA0 be the caster's MA on the status screen. 

  1. If caster has 'Strengthen: [element of spell]', then (MA1 = [MA0 * 5/4])
     else MA1 = MA0
  2. If caster has Magic AttackUP, then (MA2 = [MA1 * 4/3]), else MA2 = MA1 
  3. If target has Magic DefendUP, then (MA3 = [MA2 * 2/3]), else MA3 = MA2
  4. If target has Shell, then (MA4 = [MA3 * 2/3]), else MA5 = MA4
  5. Apply zodiac multipliers:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (MA5 = MA4 + [(MA4)/4]))
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (MA5 = MA4 - [(MA4)/4])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (MA5 = MA4 + [(MA4)/2])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (MA5 = MA4 - [(MA4)/2])
          Else MA5 = MA4
  6. Apply the spell's damage formula using MA5 = MA. If there is more
     than one instance of MA in the equation, set the MA that is a
     stand-alone multiplier to MA5, but _leave_ the other one as MA0
     (see section 1.7 for more details). If caster or target has Faith status,
     then CFa = 100 or TFa = 100, respectively. If caster or target has 
     Innocent status, then CFa = 0 or TFa = 0, respectively.
  7. If this is a snowstorm and the spell is ice-elemental, then
       damage1 = [damage * 5/4]
     If this is a thunderstorm and the spell is fire-elemental, then
       damage1 = [damage * 3/4]
     If this is a thunderstorm and the spell is lightning-elemental, then
       damage1 = [damage * 5/4]
     Else damage1 = damage
  8. If target is 'Weak' against spell's element, then
       damage2 = damage1 * 2
     Else damage2 = damage1
  9. If target has 'Half' spell's element, then
       damage3 = [damage2 / 2]
     Else damage3 = damage2
 10. If target has 'Absorb' spell's element, then
       damage4 = -(damage3)
     Else damage4 = damage3
 Damage4 will then be the amount of damage that the spell does.


[MOD: 6] ~ magical attacks : success rate variable
--------------------------------------------------

Let MA0 be the caster's MA as listed on the stat screen.

  1. If caster has 'Strengthen: [element of spell]', then (MA1 = [MA0 * 5/4])
     else MA1 = MA0
  2. If caster has Magic AttackUP, then (MA2 = [MA1 * 4/3]), else MA2 = MA1
  3. If target has Magic DefendUP, then (MA3 = [MA2 * 2/3]), else MA3 = MA2
  4. If target has Shell, then (MA4 = [MA3 * 2/3]), else MA4 = MA3
  5. Apply the spell's success% formula using MA = MA4.  If caster or target
     has Faith status, then CFa = 100 or TFa = 100, respectively.  If caster
     or target has Innocent status, then CFa = 0 or TFa = 0, respectively.
  6. Apply Zodiac modifiers to the success%:
     'Good' compatibility:  success%_zodiac = success% + [success% / 4]
     'Best' compatibility:  success%_zodiac = success% + [success% / 2]
     'Bad' compatibility:   success%_zodiac = success% - [success% / 4]
     'Worst' compatibility: success%_zodiac = success% - [success% / 2]
  7. Apply any evasion percentages that the target has due to his 
     equipment.
  If the attack also does damage and is elemental, the same elemental 
  multipliers apply to the damage as detailed in MOD 5 above.

[3.3] the big list                                                           
      =========================================================================

The list is in the following format:

 _____________________________________________________________________________

| Range: # / Effect: #v#         |                                            |
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attacks are listed in order of index number; this is the bracketed number
in the center of the top line of each box.

To find an attack: use the Find or Search feature (often Ctrl + F), and 
search for "| Attack name" (without the quotes), where "Attack name" is the 
name of the attack you're interested in. Make sure to leave one, and only one, 
space after the "|" character.

To find an index number reference from the chart or from elsewhere in the 
BMG, search for "[ xxx ]" (without the quotes), where xxx is the index number 
(in hex) of the attack. Make sure to leave spaces between the brackets and 
the beginning and end of the index number.

And away we go....

         > Jjukil <jjukil@excite.com> provided a lot of 
           information on the Frog status.
         *********************************************************

There are five types of status alterations in Final Fantasy Tactics:  
preparative, supportive, negative, damaged-derived, and miscellaneous.  
Below are summaries of all the status ailments, the effects
they have on your units, and how they can be identified.

Abbrevations:
DO   - identifies a DRAW OUT technique
MS   - identifies a MAGIC SWORD technique
(25) - status is randomly added to the target of this ability
       or weapon. rate of status addition is ~25%.
(6)  - status is randomly added to the target of this ability
       or weapon. rate of status addition is ~6.25%.
(R)  - status is added as a reaction ability
(A)  - this item confers Auto-status
(1)  - character starts battle with this status when this item is equipped

The 'Duration:' category indicates the length of time that the status
will remain in effect if left to its own devices (i.e., if the character
is targeted by no spells or effects that add, remove, or cancel out that
status).  See section A.2 for definitions of the phases of battle and of
'clockticks'.  'Infinite' in this category means the effect will last
the entire battle; all effects except 'Invite' and 'Morbol' will wear
off at the end of battle.

An ability in [brackets] indicates that the ability can only target a
certain type of unit (e.g., [Dragon Tame] only affects Dragons and Hydras).
Look the ability up in section 3.3 for more details.

Auto-statuses, set by pieces of equipment like Excalibur (Auto-Haste) and
Robe of Lords (Auto-Protect, Auto-Shell), cannot be removed unless the
equipment is de-equipped, broken, or stolen.  If a unit with an Auto-status
(e.g., Auto-Regen) is afflicted with another status that normally would 
cancel the first (e.g., Poison), the second status will take effect for its
normal duration (e.g., 35 clockticks) and then the first status will return.
During the period that the second status is in effect, both statuses will
technically be set, but only the second status will be 'expressed'.
If an item that imparts an Auto-status is equipped in battle via 
Equip Change,the status will take effect immediately and last until the 
equipment is de-equiped, broken, or stolen. Auto-statuses are not subject 
to clocktick limits.

Initial-statuses, set by equipment like the Angel Ring (Initial-Reraise)
and the Stone Gun (Initial-Petrify) take effect at the beginning of battle
and can be removed as normal. If an item that imparts an Initial-status is
equipped in battle via Equip Change, the status will NOT take effect.

To find a status by name, search for the name between brackets [ ].


_______________________________________________________________________________
[4.1] preparative status changes
      =========================================================================

These status changes occur when a character is preparing to execute an action.
They will be cancelled when the action is executed or (at your option) at the
character's next AT.

[Charging]
Appearance:  'C' in a starburst above character's head
Description:  This status occurs when a character is charging up a slow-action.
When a character is in 'Charging' status, his evade percentages will all drop 
to 0%, and all units attacking him physically will receive a bonus to their PA 
(new PA = [PA * 3/2]) (i.e., the charging character will take about 1.5 times 
as much damage from physical attacks, and physical abilities which cause non-
damaging effects (e.g., BATTLE SKILL) will have a higher chance of working). 
Add with:  Initiate spell-casting or CHARGE directive
Cancel with:  Execute directive; cancel on next AT; 
              add Berserk; add Blood Suck
Duration:  until the S+ phase when the slow-action is resolved. 

[Defending]
Appearance:  Arms crossed in defensive stance
Description:  This status is activated when the 'Defend' command is selected.
When a character is 'Defending', his evade percentages will all be doubled.
Note: if the character also has 'Abandon', his evade percentages will be 
quadrupled.  If a chracter with Abandon is defending and is attacked by a

[4.2] supportive status changes
      =========================================================================

These status changes will afford special abilities or protections to your
characters. 

[Float]
Appearance:  Character is floating 1h above the ground
Description:  This status is invoked by the 'Float' spell, the accessory
'Feather Boots', or the Move ability, 'Float'.  Characters with 'Float' 
will act as if they are stationed 1h above where they are actually
standing.  For example, if a character with Float is standing at height
9, and there is a character at height 7 trying to attack the floating
character with an attack which has a vertical tolerance of 2, he will
be unable to do so because the floater will behave as if he were 
standing at height 10.  In addition, floating characters can move over
rugged terrain such as lava and water without penalty to their
movement, and are unaffected by other terrain-based penalties such as
the inability to move in water of depth 2h or greater (a character with
'Float' will float 1h above the water level).  Furthermore, floating
characters are immune to Earth-elemental attacks.  Characters with the
'Float' movement ability (but _not_ those who received the status from
the boots, the Cherche, or from the TIME MAGIC), will be able to stop 
over lava.
Add with:  Float (TIME MAGIC), Feather Boots (A), Cherche (A), Float (M) 
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave
Duration:  infinite

[Haste]
Appearance:  Animation is sped up
Description:  Effective Speed = [Speed * 3/2].  Note that this is 
only applied in CT incrementing, and has no effect on formulas that 
depend on Speed, such as the damage for the THROW directive or an 
ATTACK with a longbow.  Haste also has no effect on the charge time
of a JUMP directive.
Cancels:   Slow
Add with:  Haste, Haste 2, MBarrier, DO Masamune, Excalibur (A), 
           Setiemson (A), Nameless Song

              add Slow
Duration:  31 clockticks

[Protect]
Appearance:  Triangle in dialogue balloon above character's head
Description:  Reduces physical damage by one-third.  More precisely,
any unit attacking the Protected unit with a physical attack will 
receive a PA penalty such that (revised PA) = [PA * 2/3]. 
Also note that though PA is the stat usually modified by Protect,
it doesn't _have_ to be.  Some physical attacks calculate damage
or success rate based on MA or Speed.  For these attacks, Protect
acts as above, except replace 'PA' with 'MA' or 'Speed'.  In
addition, physical attacks that have stat-dependent success rates
(e.g., BATTLE SKILL, STEAL) will face a penalty such that 
revised stat = [stat * 2/3] when targeting a Protected unit;
consequently, Protect can lower either the success rate or the
damage of physical attacks.  Unless it is imparted by an item, 
Protect will wear off on its own after a time.
Add with:  Protect, Protect 2, Wall, MBarrier, Protect Spirit,
           DO Kiyomori, Salty Rage (A), Save the Queen (A),

[Regen]

Duration:  35 clockticks

[Reraise]
Appearance:  Angel hovering above character's head
Description:  If character is put into 'Dead' status, he will be revived
with RU{MaxHP/10} on what would be his first AT after dying.  Reraise is 
cancelled when a character is revived by it. If an Undead character has
Reraise (this can only be accomplished with Auto-Reraise), Reraise will
have no effect other than to prevent you from seeing the Dead counter, 
and to block the 50% chance of auto-revival normally associated with
Undead status. 
Blocks:    Undead
Add with:  Reraise, MBarrier, Angel Ring (1), Chantage (A), 
           Dragon Spirit (R), Nameless Song
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave,
Duration:  until revival, one AT after Dead is added


[Shell]
Appearance:  Square in dialogue balloon above character's head
Description:  The caster of magical attacks against a unit will Shell
will have his or her MA reduced to [MA * 2/3].  This in effect reduces
the damage or success rate of magical attacks executed against the unit
with Shell.  Note that Shell does NOT affect damage from spells that 
subtract a certain percentage of the target's HP (such as Demi, Lich 
and Life Drain), though it may affect the success rate of these spells.  
Unless imparted by an item, Shell will wear off on its own after a time.
Add with:  Shell, Shell 2, Wall, MBarrier, DO Kiyomori, Clam Spirit,
           Ragnarok (A), Salty Rage (A), Robe of Lords (A), Nameless Song

[Transparent]
Appearance:  Character is translucent
Description:  Character is ignored by computer-controlled units.  Attacks
made by a Transparent character ignore all evade percentages -- physical
AND magical.  Transparent is cancelled at the end of any AT during which
the Transparent character takes an action or the Transparent character
takes any damage.

[4.3] negative status changes
      =========================================================================

These status changes will weaken your characters or impede them from
battling normally.  

[Blood Suck]
Appearance:  Character is colored purple
Description:  Character is a vampire.  He will be uncontrollable, and 
attack random units with the human version of the 'Blood Suck' [0C8] attack.  
All evade percentages will drop to 0, and character will be unable to use 
reaction abilities and certain move abilities like Move-HP Up and Move-Get Exp.  
All monsters are inherently immune to Blood Suck. A unit with Blood Suck is 
considered Unable to Fight. If all units on one team are simultaneously 
Unable to Fight, that team loses the battle.
Cancels:   Charging, Defending, Performing
Add with:  Blood Suck [0C8] (from the BLOOD SUCK command set),

Cancel with:  Deathspell 2, Holy Water
Block with:  108 Gems, Barette, Ribbon
Duration:  infinite

[Charm]
Appearance:  Heart in dialogue balloon above character's head
Description:  Character perceives enemies as allies, and allies as
enemies. For instance, a Charmed enemy can cast harmful SUMMON MAGIC
on other enemies. However, the (original) allies of a Charmed unit will
NOT perceive it as an enemy. For example, if one of your Summoners 
becomes Charmed, she can cast Shiva on your party while Charmed, but 
other units in your party cannot cast Shiva on her. If a unit on team A
is charmed by a unit on team B, mimes on team A will not mimic
that unit's actions while she is Charmed, but mimes on team B will.
The only effect of Charming an allied unit is to put that unit under
AI control until Charm is removed.
Add with:  Steal Heart, Allure, Fairy Harp (25%)
Cancel with:  HP damage to unit
Block with:  N-Kai Armlet, Barette, Ribbon
Duration:  31 clockticks

[Chicken]
Appearance:  Character is, well... a chicken
Description:  This status is caused by a character having less than 10
Brave.  The character will flee from all foes, and regain 1 Brave per
AT until he reaches 10 Brave, at which point Chicken will be cancelled.
Characters attacking a chicken will receive a PA bonus (usually, new 
PA = [PA * 3/2]) (i.e., Chickens will take about 1.5 times as much 
damage from physical attacks).  Weapon attacks that normally have
a vertical 3 tolerance when attacking from above will only have a
vetical 2 tolerance if the target is a Chicken.
Add with:  lower Brave to 9 or less
Cancel with:  raise Brave to 10
Block with:  nothing
Duration:  the number of turns it takes for Brave to increment to 10

[Confusion]
Appearance:  Awkward movements by character, speech balloon with '?'
Description:  Character will attack the unit closest to it, regardless
of whether that unit is an ally or enemy, with random attacks. Confused
units will also sometimes charge spells on unoccupied panels.  Evasion 
percentages of targets attacked by a Confused unit will be doubled.  
Confusion also prevents the use of reaction abilities and special effect-
generating Move abilities like Move-HP Up and Move-Get Exp.  Confusion will
be cancelled if the afflicted character takes damage.
Add with:     Confusion Song, MS Confuse, Confuse 2, Mind Blast,

[Death Sentence]
Appearance:  Number hovering above character
Description:  A countdown will start from 3 and decrement during each
of the affected character's ATs.  When the countdown reaches 0, the
character is given 'Dead' status.  The AI will ignore enemy units
afflicted with Death Sentence, as if they were Transparent. If the
afflicted unit is immune to Dead, Death Sentence will expire without
any ill effects when the countdown reaches 0.

and the 'Frog' BLACK MAGIC spell; characters attacking a Frog will 
receive a PA bonus (new PA = [PA * 3/2]) (i.e., Frogs will take 
about 1.5 times as much damage from physical attacks).  Attacking frogs 
deal damage equal to [PA * Br/100].  Berserk status has no effect on 
Frogs' attack damage. (Thanks to Jjukil <Jjukil@excite.com> for this 
detailed information on the Frog status.)  Weapon attacks that normally 
have a vertical 3 tolerance when attacking from above will only have a

Block with:  Jade Armlet, Cachusha, Ribbon, Black Costume
Duration:  19 clockticks
           
[Undead]
Appearance:  Character has a magenta tint
Description:  Character becomes undead.  This has several effects:
(1) most attacks which normally restore HP, such as Cure spells, Potions, 
    and the Healing Staff, will instead subtract HP.  Exception:  Chakra 
    will still heal HP.  Even though Cure spells will damage the character, 
    he still will not try to evade them.  HP loss from Cure spells will 
    still trigger damage-dependent reaction abilities, like MP Switch and
    Auto Potion (the latter of which sucks for the Undead unit, since it
    will cause even more damage!). 'Regen' status still works as normal.
(2) 'Reraise' cannot be set on that character. If the character has
    Auto-Reraise (as from Chantage or Angel Ring), then Reraise will remain
    set when Undead is set. If the Undead/Reraised character is killed,
    that character cannot be revived by any means (aside from ending the
    battle).
(3) the 'Death' spell will restore the character to full HP.  The 'Raise'
    spell will subtract [Undead Character's MaxHP / 2] HP.  The 'Raise 2'
    spell will subtract (Undead Character's Remaining HP) Note that though
    Undead absorb 'Death', they are _not_ immune to attacks that add: Dead, 
    such as Stop Bracelet. (The 'Death' spell is special-cased -- it both
    adds Dead AND subtracts (Target's Max HP) HP. The effect of the Undead
    ailment is to (a) remove the add: Dead property from 'Death', and 
    (b) reverse damage from 'Death' into healing.) Undead units will still
    try to evade 'Death', even though it's beneficial to them.
(4) HP-draining attacks, such as Life Drain and Blood Suck, work as
    follows (MP is still drained as normal).

                          effect on  effect on
                  target   caster     target
                  ------  ---------  ---------
                  normal  + HP       - HP
                  undead  - HP       + HP           

    These rules apply whether the caster is normal or whether he is 
    Undead as well.  
(5) when an Undead character has the 'Dead' status, there is a roughly
    50% chance that instead of crystallizing when the countdown runs out, 
    he will be revived with a random amount of HP (CurHP = (1..MaxHP)).
(6) when a 'Death Sentence' runs out on an undead character, it will
    simply cancel 'Death Sentence' rather than adding 'Dead'.
Blocks:    Reraise
Add with:  Zombie, MS Zombie, Zombie Touch, Bio 3 [0D2] (6%), Cursed Ring (A)

_______________________________________________________________________________
[4.4] damage-derived status changes
      =========================================================================

These status abnormalities occur when a character has sustained too much
damage in battle.

[Critical]
Appearance:  Character is kneeling
Description:  Character's current HP is less than RU{MaxHP / 5}.  Critical
has no adverse effects per se, but a Critical character is in danger of
dying.  Critical can be cancelled with HP recovery.  Certain reaction 
abilities can only be activated when the reacting unit is in Critical status.
Add with:  HP depletion
Cancel with:  HP recovery
Duration:  infinite

[Dead]
Appearance:  Character is lying on ground
Description:  Character has 0 HP and is incapacitated.  Character does
not get a turn.  When 'Dead' is set, a countdown will begin from 3 and
decrement by 1 at each AT the character would have had.  When the 
countdown reaches -1, the character either turns into a treasure box or
a crystal (50% chance of either outcome), and is removed from the game.  
Not surprisingly, a Dead unit is considered Unable to Fight. If all the
members of a team are simultaneously Unable to Fight, that team loses
the battle. (Interesting side note: because Dead cancels Blood Suck, 
and because Dead is a lot easier to remove than Blood Suck is, killing
a Blood Sucked unit is often the best way to deal with it if you don't 
have any Holy Water handy.)
Cancels:   Berserk, Blood Suck, Confusion, Charm, Charging, Critical, 
           Death Sentence, Defending, Don't Move, Don't Act, Faith,

[4.5] other status changes
      =========================================================================

These are miscellaneous status changes that do not fit into any other
category; they are not intrinsically positive or negative but can
vary depending on the situation.

[Berserk]
Appearance:  Character has a bright red tint and a red star in a
             speech balloon hovering above his head
Description:  Character's effective PA is equal to [PA * 3/2].  
Character is uncontrollable, and will always use the ATTACK

Description:  Character's Faith is considered to be 100. (exception:  
              UN-TRUTH attacks consider the character's Faith to be 
              zero.)

              100.)
Cancels:   Faith
Add with:  Doubt Faith, Innocent, Gokuu Rod (25%)
Cancel with:  add Faith 
Duration:  31 clockticks

[Invite]
Appearance:  none visible
Description:  Character joins the enemy's party (as a Guest).  An 
Invited ally becomes an enemy, and an Invited enemy becomes an ally.  
At the end of the battle, any Invited enemies will be given the chance 
to permanently join the ally party.  Invited units are considered 
Unable to Fight (for their original team). If all the members of a team
are simultaneously Unable to Fight, that team loses the battle.  As far
as I can tell, the AI will never try to Invite your units, even under
Confusion and even if Invite is the only option possible. A unit can 
only be Invited once per battle; units with Invite are immune to Invite.
Blocks:  Invite
Add with:  Invitation, {Train} (when target is Critical), {Dragon Tame}

[Reflect]

[Quick]
Appearance:  n/a
Description:  If the Quicked character is eligible (i.e., he has no 
status ailments that would prevent him from taking a turn), that 
character gets a quick-turn.  Quick is cancelled upon the beginning 
of this AT.  (If a Stopped character is Quicked, he will remain at CT
100 until after Stop wears off).  Quick-turns take precedence over all
other turns; they are placed at the top of the AT_list regardless of
the character's position on the character_list (see A.2).  See A.4
for a detailed discussion of the Quick status.

[5.1] crystals
      =========================================================================

When an enemy crystallizes and you are given the opportunity to learn its 
abilities, you will gain ALL of the abilities on the list, not just the one 
you select. 

Each ability has a characteristic chance of appearing on the list that
is generated when a unit picks up a crystal.  In order for the crystal-
picking unit to learn a given ability, these conditions must be met:

(1) The unit that left the crystal must have had the ability learned;
(2) The unit that picks up the crystal must have access to the EXACT job
    from which the dead unit learned the ability. For instance, a
    (34)-Holy Knight (Agrias' class) cannot learn Lightning Stab from 
    a dead (05)-Holy Knight (Delita's class).
    
Note that only humans can transfer abilities via crystal -- monsters
always have access to their full complement of abilities anyway, so it
would be kind of pointless.

Here are these crystallization probabilities for all the game's 
abilities.

For generic humans, he color of the crystal is an indicator of the unit's 
palette:

Ramza's units (palette 00) ............ teal-gray crystal
Hokuten units (palette 01) ............ bright blue crystal
Nanten units (palette 02) ............. red crystal
Death Corps uints (palette 03) ........ yellow crystal
Glabados Church units (palette 04) .... purplish-gray crystal

Special humans and humanoid monsters will always drop teal-gray crystals,
regardless of their palette byte (although the poof of smoke that 
accompanies crystal formation will be colored by the palette byte).

Standard monsters' crystal color is determined by the unit's 'tier' within
its species.

Tier 1 monsters (Chocobo, Goblin, etc.) ................ teal-gray crystal
Tier 2 monsters (Black Chocobo, Black Goblin, etc.) .... bright blue crystal
Tier 3 monsters (Red Chocobo, Gobbledeguck, etc.) ...... red crystal

[5.2] counter magic
      =========================================================================

The 'Counter Magic' reaction ability causes a character to
respond to a magical attack with the same magical attack, with the
caster of the original magic being the epicenter of the countered
magic's range.  Counter Magic is activated by the following spells:

- All Black Magic except Fire 4, Ice 4, and Bolt 4
- Holy, Dark Holy
- Yin-Yang Magic except Pray Faith and Doubt Faith
- Slow, Slow 2, Don't Move, Quick, Stop, Demi, Demi 2, Meteor
- Bio, Bio 2, Bio 3
- Melt, Tornado, Quake
- Attacks from the Blaze Gun, Glacier Gun, and Blast Gun

For a discussion of the Counter Magic-Quick phenomenon, see section A.3.

Counter Magic cannot counter Calculated spells, nor can it counter
spells which have already been Reflected.  Similarly, a spell cast by
Counter Magic cannot be Reflected.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.3] experience and job points
      =========================================================================
      
EXPERIENCE
----------

The Exp that a unit will gain when performing an action is given
by the following equation.

Exp = [Max{(10 + (T_Lv - C_Lv) + D), 1} * M]

     where T_Lv is the target's level
           C_Lv is the caster's (attacker's) level
           M = 2 if the caster has 'Gained Exp-UP'
               1 otherwise
           D is a 'death modifier' that only applies if the action
             kills its target. We define the variable PrevKills as the
             number of times the target has been killed previously in
             this battle, excluding the current kill. D is then determined
             as follows:
             
             If PrevKills = 0, then D = +10
             If PrevKills = 1, then D =   0
             If PrevKills = 2, then D =  -4
             If PrevKills = 3, then D =  -5
             If PrevKills = 4, then D =  -6
             If PrevKills = 5, then D =  -7
             If PrevKills > 5, then D =  -8
             
             (Thanks to Degenerator 12 <degenerator12@hotmail.com> for this
              information!)
           
     As an example of this, let's imagine a level 50 unit without Gained Exp-UP
     killing a level 53 unit repeatedly. It doesn't matter if the killing is 
     accomplished by adding Dead directly or by depleting the unit's HP.
     
     First kill:     PrevKills = 0, D = 10
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) + 10) = 13 + 10 = 23
                  
     Second kill:    PrevKills = 1, D = 0
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) + 0) = 13 + 0 = 13
                     
     Third kill:     PrevKills = 2, D = -1
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) - 1) = 13 - 1 = 12
     .
     .
     .
                     
     Sixth kill:     PrevKills = 5, D = -8
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) - 8) = 13 - 8 = 5
                     
     Seventh kill:   PrevKills = 6, D = -8
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) - 8) = 13 - 8 = 5
     .
     .
     .
     
     And so on. As you can see, killing a unit nets you extra experiencne at
     first, but if you repeatedly kill the unit, you are penalized. The bonuses
     to Exp for consecutive kills of the same unit run as follows: +10, 0, -4,
     -5, -6, -7, -8, -8, -8, .... The -8 seems to go on ad infinitum. Remember,
     minimum Exp that an action can give is 1.
     
If the action has multiple (let's say N) targets, the caster will be awarded
Max{Exp.(1),Exp.(2), ... ,Exp.(N)}, where Exp.(X) refers to the experience 
awarded for executing the action on target X.


JOB POINTS
----------
     
JP are doled out according to this equation:

JP = [(8 + (JobLevel * 2) + [Lv / 4]) * M]

where JobLevel is caster's level at their current job 
           (can range from 1 - 8)
      Lv is the level of the person performing the action
      M is 3/2 if the caster has 'Gained JP-UP'
           1 otherwise

JP SHARING
When unit X gains JP, everyone else in the party will earn
[gained JP / 4] towards the job which unit X currently has.
Note: if unit X has 'Gained JP-UP', the extra JP given by that
ability are ignored in the JP sharing equation.

Monsters do not receive JP.

[5.4] learning magic without jp
      =========================================================================

The spells Ultima and Zodiac must be learned 'blue mage style':  by 
experiencing their effects.  However, other spells can be learned 
in this manner as well.  In order for a unit to learn a spell blue mage
style, his or her current job MUST coincide with the spell's job of origin.
The learning unit must be a target of the spell, the spell must succeed on
the learning unit. Success is defined as dealing damage greater than zero
(for damaging attacks) or adding the intended status (for status-adding
attacks). If these conditions are met, the target will be given a chance
to learn the spell.

_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.5] weather and terrain
      =========================================================================

The weather and terrain on the battlefield can have a (limited)
influence on the battle mechanics.

Normally you can move a number of sqaures equal to your Move statistic,
so we might say that moving one square uses one 'Move Point'.

WATER
-----

When moving through flowing water, moving one square instead uses two Move
Points.  You cannot advance a square in flowing water unless you have
two Move Points left.  This means if you have a Move of 5, you will only
be able to move two squares in flowing water.  This effect is nullified if
the unit in question has the movement abilities 'Any Ground' or 
'Move Undrwater' equipped.

Stagnant water has no effect on Move under normal conditions.  However, if
it is raining heavily or thunderstorming, stagnant water (as in marshes 
and small ponds) also requires two Move Points to traverse one square.
This effect is nullified if the unit in question has the movement abilities
'Any Weather' or 'Move Undrwater' equipped.

When standing in water, you are considered to be at a height equal to the
stated height of the panel minus the depth of the water, unless you have
an ability that changes this such as 'Float' (which allows you to hover 1h
over the water) or 'Move in Water' (which allows you to walk on the water).

If a unit is submerged in water 2h deep or greater, the unit cannot Act
or use reaction abilities (including Abandon and Blade Grasp, which will
become disabled).  This effect is neutralized if the unit has the 'Float'
status or the movement abilities 'Move in Water' or 'Walk on Water'.


THUNDERSTORMS
-------------

In some battles, thunderstorms will be occurring.  If this is the 
case, then damage from Lightning-elemental spells = [normal_damage * 5/4] 
and damage from Fire-elemental spells = [normal_damage * 3/4].  This 
effect is also nullified if the caster has the 'Any Weather' ability.


SNOWSTORMS
----------

In the case of a snowstorm during battle, damage from Ice-elemental
spells = [normal_damage * 5/4].  This, too, is nullified if the caster
has 'Any Weather'.


SLOPED PANELS
-------------

When moving onto a panel over a height difference, the overall height of
the panel is irrelevant; what is relevant is the height of the edge that
borders the panel you are moving to.  To illustrate:

                 
       (B) - stated height = '7'         
      |\         8   Assume each panel is two characters wide, and 1h =
      | \        7   1 character high.  A unit standing on C (3h)
      |  |       6   with a Jump of 3 can make it onto panel (B), even
      |  |       5   though the stated height is 7, because the closer
   (A)|  |(C)    4   edge is of height 6.  Similarly, a unit standing
 --|--    --|--| 3   on (A) with a Jump of 4 _cannot_ make it onto panel
                     (B), even though the stated height is 7, because
                     the closer edge is at height 8.


HORIZONTAL JUMPING
------------------

A unit is able to jump over a horizontal gap of length [Jump / 2] panels,
where 'Jump' is the unit's Jump statistic.  Jump +1, Jump +2, and Jump +3
increase your ability to Jump horizontally, as they affect your Jump
statistic directly, but Ignore Height does not, as it only permits
infinite vertical jumping.


FALLING
-------

If a character falls (because of the knocking back effect of Throw 
Stone, a critical hit, or a similar attack) a distance greater than
his Jump statistic, he will sustain damage:

fall_damage = RU{((fall_distance - Jump) * MaxHP) / 10}


STEEL NEEDLE TRAPS
------------------

Steel Needle traps deal damage equal to [MaxHP / 5].


DEGENERATOR TRAPS
-----------------

Degenerator traps cause you to lose 1 level, and lose the stat growth
that you would have gained during that level up had it occured in your
current job.  If you step on one at level 1, you will remain at level 1,
but your stats will still undergo a decrease according to the level down
formula found in section 7.4.


A SHOT IN THE DARK
------------------

When the battle takes place at night, there is an accuracy 
penalty charged to users of bows and crossbows.  A target's
evade percentages (P.CEv, P.SEv, P.AEv) are increased as follows:

night_evade = RU{evade * 4/3}

Note that this doesn't apply for guns.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.6] blade grasp
      =========================================================================

The Samurai's 'Blade Grasp' is a powerful little reaction ability
which has the effect of adding an additional evade multiplier of
(1 - (Br/100)) to the success% of the attack in question.  Blade
Grasp is not the same as evasion, however -- several attacks which
can be evaded cannot be blocked by Blade Grasp, and a few that can
be blocked by Blade Grasp cannot be evaded by other means.  Blade
Grasp works on the same attacks that Counter does (see the list in
section 3.3), with the exception that Blade Grasp works against Spell Guns,
while Counter does not.

Note that in the case of a Two Swords attack, Blade Grasp can only block
one of the two hits -- if the first hit is Grasped, the second can't be (but
if the first hit connects, the second can be Grasped). 

Blade Grasp does not activate in response to blows from the Counter, 
Hamedo or Meatbone Slash reaction abilities.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.7] teleport
      =========================================================================

(thanks to Goryus on the GameFAQs FFT Message Board for this data)

The 'Teleport' ability from the Time Mage is one of the game's best,
allowing a unit to ignore height differences and pass through walls
and obstacles.  Teleport can fail if you attempt to teleport too far,
however, and the success rate is given by the formula below.

success% = min(100, (100 - 10 * (teleport_distance - move)))

where 'teleport_distance' is the number of squares that you are
teleporting -- note that just as with normal movement, each square 
you move diagonally counts as two squares, because you can only move 
in four directions (forward, backward, left and right).

'Move' is the Move stat of the person who is teleporting.

This equation essentially means that you are penalized 10% for each
square outside your movement range that you attempt to teleport.  If
you teleport inside your movement range, you are guaranteed success.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.8] random events
      =========================================================================

(thanks to Goryus for the data in this section)

There are a few attacks in FFT that have an additional effect sometimes
when they are used.  These include the Holy Sword attacks, weapons with
'Add:', and the Dash and Throw Stone abilities.  Here is a list of
random occurrences along with their probabilities of happening.

EVENT            PROB.  DESCRIPTION / EXAMPLES
--------------   -----  -----------------------------------------------
Add status        25%   when the status name appears in red in the
                        damage prediction area.  examples include
                        Death Sentence from Split Punch, Frog from the
                        Nagrarock, and all the status ailments caused
                        by Geomancy.  The one exception to this is
                        Blood Suck, which seems to have a 100% success
                        rate on the human version, and a 25% success
                        rate on the Vampire version.
Weapon's magic    25%   random spellcasting from weapons like the Ice 
                        Brand, Fire Rod, Holy Lance, and Lightning Bow
Spell quote       15%   long spell quote vs. only the name of the spell
Critical hit       5%   a physical attack that causes more damage.
                        it will make a different sound and the damage
                        numbers will appear in a different way than
                        usual.  See section 2.1 for details.
Katana breakage   15%   when using DRAW OUTs
Knockback         50%   targets of certain attacks will be knocked 
                        back one square (assuming there is an empty square 
                        in back of where the target is standing) fifty 
                        percent of the time.  The following attacks
                        can trigger this: (Critical hit), Dash, Throw Stone,
                        Cat Kick, Tail Swing.
Undead revival    50%   a unit with 'Undead' status will be revived
                        with a random number of HP from 1 to (MaxHP)
                        instead of crystallizing when the Dead
                        counter reaches -1.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.9] longbow range modifications
      =========================================================================

Normally, longbows can fire between three and five squares away 
from the archer.  However, height differences modify this range.
Call this height difference 'HD':

HD = (shooter's height - target's height)

bow range = 5 + [HD / 2]

This means that you get a +1 range extension for each 2h in
vertical height if you are higher, and a -1 range penalty for
every 2h in vertical height if you are lower.

Crossbows are not subject to this range modification.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.10] on brave and faith
       ========================================================================

When the game generates new units, it randomly assigns Brave and Faith values,
with the exception of a few story battle enemies (bosses and the Wizards at
Bethla Sluice, for example) that have fixed Faith. The range of Brave and 
Faith values depends on where the unit is generated:

UNIT IS GENERATED   RANGE OF BR & FA
-----------------   ----------------
At start of game    (45..74)
As random enemy     (45..74)
In soldier office   (40..70)
From monster egg    (40..70)

Unlike most other stats, you can permanently change Brave and Faith
during a battle.  The formula by which the permanent Brave or Faith
gain is determined is

permanent_BraveGain = [battle_BraveGain / 4]
permanent_FaithGain = [battle_FaithGain / 4]

where battle_BraveGain = (Brave at end of battle - Brave at start of battle)
      battle_FaithGain = (Faith at end of battle - Brave at start of battle)

To write the equation in plain English: for ever four points of Brave or Faith 
you gain (lose) in battle, you will gain (lose) one permanently.

Furthermore, if your Brave gets too low, or your Faith too high, bad things
will happen.

If his or her Faith is greater than or equal to 95 at the end of a battle, any 
character except for Ramza or a Guest will immediately leave the party out of 
religious fervor, never to be heard from again (maybe they join the 
Glabadosian Right?).

If the unit's Faith is 85 to 94, you'll sometimes receive 'Warnings' at
the end of battle warning you how your bloodthirsty ways are unholy.

If the unit's Brave is 5 or lower at the end of a battle, the unit will 
immediately leave the party due to cowardice.

If the unit's Brave is 6 to 15, you'll sometimes get a cowardly 'Warning' 
at the end of the battle.

The above apply to in-battle Brave and Faith values, not permanent Brave
and Faith values.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.11] enemy levels
       ========================================================================

Levels of enemy units in FFT can be determined by three different schemes. 

FIXED LEVEL:  This is used for most enemies in story battles. The enemy's 
level is fixed at a certain value and will always be the same, regardless of
the levels of your party members. For instance, Velius is always at Level 31.


VARIABLE RANDOM:  This is used for most enemies in random battles. The enemy's
level is randomly chosen based on the highest-levelled member of your party.
This counts all units on your 16-man roster, regardless of whether you 
actually bring them into battle. If we call the level of this highest-levelled
unit 'HiLv':
                   enemy level = ((HiLv - [HiLv/8]) .. HiLv)


VARIABLE NONRANDOM:  This scheme is used for certain enemies in random 
battles and is especially prevalent in the Deep Dungeon. If we use the same
definition of HiLv as above:
                            enemy level = HiLv + K
       where K is some constant (in practice, it ranges from 0 to ~24)
 
In all cases, the maximum level that can be generated is 99.

_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.12] missing and guarding
       ========================================================================

When attacks fail to connect, there are a few different messages that can be
displayed.

'Missed!' is displayed under the following conditions:
    (1) The attack misses due to inherent inaccuracy (most status-inducing
        attacks, STEAL and BATTLE SKILL commands don't have a 100% success
        rate, even independent of evasion).
    (2) The target evades the attack through its C-Ev (class evasion).
    (3) The target is not a valid target for the attack, but the attack
        would have been beneficial to the unit had it succeeded (e.g., 
        casting Dragon Care on a target that is not a Dragon or Hydra).

'Guarded' is displayed under the following conditions:
    (1) The target has inherent, equipment-mediated, or status-mediated 
        immunity to the effect of the attack (e.g., trying to target Stop 
        on a unit with the Black Costume, trying to use status effects 
        on a Zodiac beast with inherent immunity, or trying to Invite a 
        unit that has already been Invited).
    (2) The target evades the attack through its S-Ev (shield evasion).
        In this case, an image of the target's shield will also appear.
    (3) The target evades the attack through its W-Ev (weapon evasion)
        in conjunction with Weapon Guard. In this case, an image of the
        target's weapon will also appear.
    (3) The target evades the attack through its A-Ev (mantle evasion).
    (4) The target dodges the attack through Blade Grasp. In this case,
        the target will also raise both arms.
    (5) The target is not a valid target for the attack, but the 
        attack would have been harmful to the target had it succeeded
        (e.g., casting Seal Evil on a non-Unead unit or casting a
        MIGHTY SWORD attack on a unit lacking the proper piece of 
        equipment).
        
'Caught' is displayed if a unit intercepts a THROW attack using the
Catch reaction ability.
 
Attacks on Dead units (other than those that cancel: Dead) will not even
graphically resolve, nor will attacks targeted on units of the wrong team
(Allure on an ally, for example).

_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.1] reaction abilities
      =========================================================================

I've divided reaction abilities into five groups, based on how they are
triggered: pseudo-support abilities, damage-triggered abilities, countergrasp 
abilities, abilities activated when critical, and other abilities.

No reaction abilities will activate if the reacting unit has Berserk,
Blood Suck, Don't Act, Sleep, Confusion or Stop.

PSEUDO-SUPPORT ABILITIES:  These reaction abilities act more like support
abilities, in that they do not depend on Brave, nor do they require a specific 
trigger to activate -- essentially, they are always active if set.  These are
good choices for low-Brave units.

    [Abandon] (400 JP, Ninja):  This ability doubles all inherent, shield,
    accessory, and weapon evade percentages.  That is, instead of (1 - Ev),
    each evasion statistic contributes a multiplier of (1 - 2*Ev) to the
    success percent equation for evadable attacks.

    [Weapon Guard] (200 JP, Knight):  This ability enables your weapon evasion 
    (W-EV) statistic.

DAMAGE-TRIGGERED ABILTIES:  These abilities are triggered if you receive
HP damage from any OTHER unit -- including 0 damage.  They will trigger 
(Brave)% of the time.

    [A Save] (550 JP, Dancer):  PA +1.

    [Auto Potion] (400 JP, Chemist):  Use a Potion (recovers 30 HP).  If
    you have no Potions in stock, use a Hi-Potion (recovers 70 HP).  If
    you have no Hi-Potions in stock, use an X-Potion (recovers 150 HP).
    If you have none of these potions in stock, the ability has no effect.

    [Caution] (200 JP, Thief):  Add: Defending.
     
    [Damage Split] (300 JP, Calculator):  The unit that damaged you will
    take RU{damage / 2} damage and you will recover RU{damage / 2} HP. 
    (Will only trigger if damage > 0.)

    [Gilgame Heart] (200 JP, Thief):  Steal (Damage * 10) gil from the enemy,
    where Damage is the amount of damage that was just done to you.

    [MA Save] (450 JP, Bard):  MA +1.

    [Regenerator] (400 JP, Priest):  Add: Regen.

    [Speed Save] (800 JP, Archer):  Speed +1.

COUNTERGRASP:  So called from the two most popular reaction abilities of
this class, Counter and Blade Grasp, these attacks will be triggered by
any of the physical attacks listed below.  The attack does not have to
succeed or cause damage in order for the reaction ability to activate.
Like most reaction abilities, these will activate Br% of the time.

           ------------LIST OF COUNTERGRASP ACTIVATORS-------------
          |========================================================|
          |  ATTACK*           Eye Gouge         Beaking           |

          |  ** Vampire version of 'Blood Suck' only!              |
           --------------------------------------------------------

    [Blade Grasp] - 700 JP, Samurai  
    This ability makes the base hit percentage for Countergraspable 
    attacks executed against you equal to (Base - Br) instead of Base, 
    where Base is the success rate of the attack before evasion is 
    considered.  Unlike the other Countergrasp reaction abilities, 
    Blade Grasp DOES work against magic guns.  Blade Grasp can only 
    activate once per attack, so it will at most block one of the two 
    hits from a Two Swords attack.  Blade Grasp is NOT considered to 
    be evasion, and its effects stack with those of evasion.  See 
    section 5.6 for details.

    [Brave Up] - 500 JP, Dancer
    Br +3.

    [Counter] - 300 JP, Monk
    If the unit which attacked you is within range of your equipped 
    weapon, you will counter with an ATTACK directive. The Counter-ATTACK
    can't trigger reactions (except pseudo-supports), which means it can't
    be blocked by Blade Grasp.

    [Counter Tackle] - 180 JP, Squire)
    If the unit that attacked you is within range of 'Dash', you will 
    counter with 'Dash'.

    [Dragon Spirit] - 560 JP, Lancer  
    Add: Reraise, unless you already have Reraise or are immune to 
    Reraise.

    [Sunken State] - 900 JP, Ninja 
    Add: Transparent, unless you are immune to Transparent.

ABILITIES ACTIVATED WHEN IN CRITICAL STATUS:  These abilities will 
activate Br% of the time if you receive HP damage from ANOTHER unit
(including 0 damage) and are in Critical status after that damage 
resolves. It doesn't matter whether or not you were Critical before
the damage was dealt.

    [Critical Quick] - 700 JP, Time Mage
    Add: Quick.  This ability can be used to set up 'The Quickening', 
    which allows your units to get infinite turns.  See Shinmen 
    Takazo's excellent Quickening FAQ on gamefaqs.com for details.

    [HP Restore] - 500 JP, Monk
    Restore (your MaxHP - your CurrentHP) HP. (In other words,
    restore your HP to maximum.)

    [Meatbone Slash] - 200 JP, Samurai
    If the attacker is within range of your weapon, you will counter
    with 'Meatbone Slash', a neutral MOD 0 attack that deals damage 
    equal to your Max HP.

    [MP Restore] - 400 JP, Summoner
    Restore (your MaxMP - your CurrentMP) MP. (In other words,
    restore your MP to maximum.)

OTHER REACTION ABILITIES:  These don't fit in any category.

    [Absorb Used MP] - 250 JP, Oracle 
    Whenever another unit uses an ability that costs MP, and you are 
    one of the targets, you have a Br% chance of gaining the amount 
    of MP that the other unit consumed.

    [Arrow Guard] - 450 JP, Archer  
    This is like Blade Grasp, but it only works on bow and crossbow 
    attacks (this includes ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL, and SNIPE, 
    with bow or crossbow equipped).  See 'Blade Grasp'.

    [Catch] - 200 JP, Thief  
    If you are targeted with a THROW attack, you will catch the 
    item and add it to your inventory Br% of the time. The message 
    'Caught' will be displayed in red upon a successful Catch.  
    Mimed THROW attacks cannot be Caught (I guess this is because no 
    'real' item is consumed for a mimed THROW).

    [Counter Flood] - 300 JP, Geomancer  
    If you are targeted by a Counter Flood-enabled attack (Check 
    the big list (section 3.3) to see if an attack is Counter Flood-
    enabled. For the most part, these are Countergraspable attacks 
    that also cause damage, plus ELEMENTAL attacks and some other 
    oddballs), you will counter with an ELEMENTAL directive 
    corresponding to the ground you are currently standing on, 
    regardless of your assailant's distance from you and regardless of 
    whether you have actually learned that ability.  The ELEMENTAL 
    directive will have its usual effect area, so if one of your units 
    happens to be standing next to the target of Counter Flood and is 
    on the same height, (s)he'll be damaged too!  Like most reactions, 
    Counter Flood will activate Br% of the time.

    [Counter Magic] - 800 JP, Wizard 
    If you are targeted by a magic gun or a spell that is subject to 
    Counter Magic (see the big list in section 3.3), you will cast that 
    spell back at the caster, paying the appropriate MP cost.  This 
    will activate Br% of the time.

    [Distribute] - 200 JP, Calculator  
    If you are healed by another unit (this ability does NOT activate if 
    you are healing yourself!), every allied unit that does not have full 
    HP will gain RU{(gained_HP - (maxHP - curHP)) / N}, where gained_HP 
    is the magnitude of the triggering HP gain, maxHP is your maximum HP, 
    curHP was your current HP before the HP gain, and N is the number of 
    allied units that do not have full HP. (In other words, any excess 
    healing will be split equally (round up) among all other party 
    members that are not at full HP.  Note that only one unit's healing 
    will be shown in the animation, but all units that do not have full
    HP will be healed.)  This ability will activate Br% of the time.

    [Face Up] - 500 JP, Bard  
    If you are targeted by any Faith-based magical attack, this 
    ability will increase your Faith by 3.  It works Br% of the time.

    [Finger Guard] - 300 JP, Mediator  
    Base success percentage of TALK SKILL attacks executed against 
    you is now equal to (Base% - Br%).
       
    [Hamedo] - 1200 JP, Monk  
    If you are targeted by an ATTACK, BATTLE SKILL, THROW, or CHARGE 
    directive and your attacker is within range of your weapon, the 
    attacker's directive will be cancelled and you will instead 
    execute an ATTACK directive on the attacker.  The Hamedo-ATTACK
    cannot trigger reactions (except for pseudo-supports).  Note that 
    this only works on the above-listed commands, which means it is 
    useless on monsters, since they have special forms of physical 
    attack.  (And even though Berserk units can only ATTACK, Hamedo
    still doesn't work on Berserked monsters.)  This ability will 
    trigger Br% of the time.  Note: unlike Counter, Hamedo will
    activate against spell guns.

    [MP Switch] - 400 JP, Time Mage  
    If you receive HP damage and your CurMP > 0, the damage will 
    instead be dealt to your MP Br% of the time.  This works on 
    almost _any_ source of damage, including Poison, falling damage,
    and self-inflicted damage.  It does not, however, work on damage 
    incurred by other reaction abilities like Hamedo, Counter, and 
    Meatbone Slash.

    [Reflect] - 200 JP, GameShark only  
    This has no effect.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.2] support abilities
      =========================================================================

Unlike most reaction abilities, support abilities, once equipped, are
always active.

[Attack UP] - 400 JP, Geomancer  
For physical attacks except JUMP and some others (see 3.3), the effective 
value of your relevant stat XA = [XA * 4/3].  Usually, stat XA is PA, but it 
can sometimes be MA (as in a stick ATTACK), or Speed (as in a STEAL 
directive).  Check the list in section 3.3 to see whether an attack is 
physical. 

[Concentrate] - 400 JP, Archer  
Targets cannot evade your physical attacks via their evasion percentages 
(P.CEV, P.SEV, P.AEV, W-EV).  Note that this does not guarantee 100% success 
on attacks such as BATTLE SKILL, since these attacks can still MISS.  Targets 
may also still evade using the 'Blade Grasp' and 'Arrow Guard' abilities.
Concentrate has no effect on magic evasion.

[Defend] - 50 JP, Squire  
Adds the DEFEND command (add: Defending on the caster) to your action menu.

[Defense UP] - 400 JP, Oracle 
For physical attacks except JUMP and some others (see 3.3), units attacking 
you receive a penalty to their relevant stat XA such that XA = [XA * 2/3].
Usually, stat XA is PA, but it can sometimes be MA (as in a stick ATTACK), 
or Speed (as in THROW).  Check the list in section 3.3 to see whether an 
attack is physical.

[Equip Armor] - 500 JP, Knight  
You can equip armor and helmets regardless of your current job.

[Equip Axe] - 200 JP, Squire
You can equip axes regardless of your current job.

[Equip Change] - 0 JP, Chemist
Adds the EQUIP CHANGE command to your action menu.  This allows you to 
change your equipment in battle.  Using EQUIP CHANGE counts as an
action.
  
[Equip Crossbow] - 350 JP, Archer
You can equip crossbows regardless of your current job.

[Equip Gun] - 750 JP, Mediator
You can equip guns (both regular and magical) regardless of your 
current job.

[Equip Knife] - 400 JP, Samurai
You can equip katana regardless of your current job.

[Equip Shield] - 250 JP, Knight
You can equip shields regardless of your current job.

[Equip Spear] - 400 JP, Lancer
You can equip spears regardless of your current job.

[Equip Sword] - 400 JP, Knight
You can equip swords (but not knight swords) regardless of your 
current job.

[Gained Exp-UP] - 350 JP, Calculator
When you receive experience for an action, you receive bonus experience 
such that received Experience = earned Exp * 2.

[Gained JP-UP] - 200 JP, Squire
When you receive JP for an action, you receive bonus JP such that received
JP = [earned JP * 3/2].

[Half of MP] - 900 JP, Summoner
Any MP-using ability now takes half as many MP to use (round up). 
(HalfMPCost = RU{MPCost / 2})

[Magic AttackUP] - 400 JP, Wizard  
For magical attacks, the effective value of your MA = [MA * 4/3].  
This does not include physical attacks (such as stick and staff ATTACK) 
that use MA as their relevant stat. Check the list in section 3.3 to see 
whether an attack is magical. 

[Magic DefendUP] - 400 JP, Priest  
For magical attacks targeting you, the effective value of the caster's 
MA = [MA * 2/3].  This does not include physical attacks (such as stick and
staff ATTACK) which use MA as their relevant stat. Check the list in section
3.3 to see whether an attack is magical. 
 
[Maintenance] - 250 JP, Chemist
Your equipment cannot be stolen or broken.  Any attack that steals or 
breaks equipment will have a 0% success rate if targeted against you.

[Martial Arts] - 200 JP, Monk
If you are barehanded, your effective XA for physical attacks except JUMP 
and THROW is equal to [XA * 3/2].  If you are not barehanded, those 
physical attacks that are weapon-elemental (ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL, 
SNIPE, sword skills) will not receive the bonus.

[Monster Skill] - 200 JP, Squire
Monsters standing on squares adjacent to you will have access to a new 
skill (vertical tolerance 3).  This will have no effect if you are
Berserk, Confused, or Unable to Fight.

[Monster Talk] - 100 JP, Mediator
Enables the use of TALK SKILL on monsters, regardless of your job.

[Non-charge] - 3000 JP, GameShark only
All slow actions, except for JUMP, CHARGE, SING, and DANCE, become fast 
actions.

[Secret Hunt] - 200 JP, Thief
If you kill a monster with damage from your weapon (i.e., through ATTACK, 
CHARGE or Counter), you will poach it; that is, it will be transformed 
into an item that you can buy at one of the Fur Shops located around Ivalice.
Items bought at the Fur Shop will be half their normal price!  Also, you can
sell any item to the Fur Shop to raise some quick cash, and then later buy 
it back for the same amount you sold it for!  It's like an interest-free 
loan.

[Short Charge] - 800 JP, Time Mage
For all slow actions except for JUMP, CHARGE, SING and DANCE, 
ctr = RU{ctr/2}.

[Throw Item] - 350 JP, Chemist 
Range of ITEM becomes 4/1 (line of sight), regardless of your current job.

[Train] - 450 JP, Mediator  
If you strike a monster directly with your weapon (e,g., through ATTACK, 
CHARGE, or Counter), and that monster is Critical after the attack 
resolves, you will also add: Invite to that same monster.

[Two Hands] - 900 JP, Samurai
You are able to grip one-handed weapons with both hands, doubling 
weapon power (does not apply to non-striking weapons like guns and 
crossbows).  Weapon power is doubled for the ATTACK command only and 
does not affect other physical attacks -- even those that employ weapons 
such as JUMP, BATTLE SKILL, HOLY SWORD, DARK SWORD and MIGHTY SWORD. 
(It does apply, however, to the ATTACK that results from targetting a 
BATTLE SKILL on a piece of equipment that the target does not have.)

[Two Swords] - 900 JP, Ninja  
You are able to equip two one-handed weapons at once.  This has some 
interesting upshots -- for instance, all BATTLE SKILL, CHARGE, and 
SNIPE directives are executed twice if you are carrying two weapons.
In addition, if you attack a target that has Blade Grasp set, 
Blade Grasp can only block one of the two hits that you incur.  If
the first hit of a Two Sworded attack fails to connect for any 
reason (evade, Blade Grasp, or inherent inaccuracy of the attack), 
then the target will turn to face the attacker prior to the second 
hit, and the second hit will be treated as if it were executed 
from the front (i.e., all possible evade parameters will be 
considered).


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.3] movement abilities
      =========================================================================

Movement abilities allow you to move about the battlefield more easily, or
activate special powers when you move.

[Any Ground] - 220 JP, Geomancer 
Normally each square of flowing water you walk through costs you two movement 
points instead of one.  With this ability, the movement penalty to walk through 
flowing water vanishes.

[Any Weather] - 200 JP, Oracle
Normally, you can walk over marsh sqaures without suffering the water penalty.
However, if it is raining heavily in a marshland, you will face a similar 
penalty -- you must use two movement points for every square of marsh you 
move over.  If you have Any Weather equipped, that penalty will not take 
effect.  In addition, weather effects on magic (increase in Lightning damage 
and decrease in Fire damage during thunderstorms) are nullified if the caster
has Any Weather.  This is in a heated battle with Move on Lava for the title
of 'most useless ability'. And another curiosity:  the programmers gave the 
Steel Giant class Any Ground and Any Weather inherent, but they also gave 
it Cannot enter water inherent, making Any Ground and Any Weather completely
useless! Perhaps they intended to program more weather and terrain effects 
into the game but never got around to it.

[Cannot enter water] - 200 JP, inherent for several monsters)
You cannot move or stop on squares that are submerged in water.

[Float] - 540 JP, Time Mage 
Add: Float.  And it can't be removed.  Unlike the Feather Boots and the 
Float spell, this will allow you to stop on lava squares.

[Fly] - 1200 JP, Bard and Dancer
Allows you to fly over all height differences, enemies, and obstacles.
Nullifies fall damage.

[Ignore Height] - 700 JP, Lancer
You are able to jump to any vertical height, regardless of your 'Jump' 
stat.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +1] - 200 JP, Archer
'Jump' stat + 1.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +2] - 480 JP, Thief  
'Jump' stat + 2.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +3] - 1000 JP, Dancer
'Jump' stat + 3.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Move +1] - 200 JP, Squire
'Move' stat + 1.

[Move +2] - 520 JP, Thief
'Move' stat + 2.

[Move +3] - 1000 JP, Bard
'Move' stat + 3.

[Move in Water] - 420 JP, Ninja
You can move (and stop) on top of water; water is treated like 
normal ground.

[Move on Lava] - 150 JP, Geomancer
You can move (and stop) on top of lava; lava is treated like 
normal ground.

[Move Undrwater] - 200 JP, inherent for Mindflayer type monsters 
You can move (and stop) in water up to 3h deep without penalty. 

[Move-Find Item] - 100 JP, Chemist
You can extract hidden items from booby-trapped squares without
triggering the traps. Each square has two items: the odds of getting
one (usually the commoner item) are Br%, and the odds of getting the
other (usually the rarer item) are (100 - Br)%.

[Move-Get Exp] - 400 JP, Calculator
You gain 1 Exp. per panel moved, unless you are afflicted with 
Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-Get JP] - 360 JP, Calculator
You gain 2 JP per panel moved, unless you are afflicted with 
Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-HP Up] - 300 JP, Monk
Recover RU{MaxHP / 10} HP if you move at least one panel, unless 
you are afflicted with Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-MP Up] - 350 JP, Oracle
Recover RU{MaxMP / 10} MP if you move at least one panel, unless y

[Silent Walk] - 700 JP, GameShark only
No known effect.

[Teleport] - 600 JP, Time Mage
Able to teleport through obstacles, height differences, units, etc.  
Chance of success is 100% within your Move range and decreases 10%

            CzarDragon's site) that the stat multipliers and C
            values were stored in the RAM.
          *********************************************************


_______________________________________________________________________________
[7.1] the stats you know
      =========================================================================

All the formulae in the previous section contain just a handful of quantities 
that, in various combinations, determine the damage or success rate of an 
attack.  Here is a brief review of those quantities:

BRAVE (Br) is a numerical representation of a unit's courage.  Its initial 
value for a unit (except predefined special characters) is randomly generated
between 45 and 74 (start of game; random enemies) or 40 and 70 (soldier office;
bred monsters).  It can be raised or lowered by various effects.

FAITH (Fa) numerically represents belief in magical and supernatural phenomena.
Its initial value is determined in the same way as Brave's, and it too can be 
easily altered.

LEVEL (Lv) is a quantity representing how experienced a unit is in battle.  
Generics start at level 1; special allies and enemies in story battles start 
at preset levels; units in random battles start at levels comparable to the 
highest-levelled unit in your party (see section 5.11). A unit goes up one 
Level for every 100 Experience Points gained.

HIT POINTS (HP) are a measure of how much damage a unit can take before 
expiring.  Armors can add HP to a unit, but the base HP of a unit are 
dependent on a unit's class and are determined through a complex 
process which is detailed in section 7.2.

MAGIC POINTS (MP) allow your character to cast magic spells.  Armors can 
also add MP, but the base MP are dependent on a unit's class and are 
determined through a process similar to that for HP.

PHYSICAL ATTACK POWER (PA) governs the strength of a number of attacks, 
usually involving the body, fists, or weapons.  PA can be modified by 
equipment, but a unit's base PA is dependent on its class, gender,
and a number of other factors.

MAGICAL ATTACK POWER (MA) imparts strength to magic spells and other 
magical (and a few physical) attacks.  It is determined in a similar way 
that PA is, dependent on the same things.

SPEED (Sp) is a unit's quickness, and also influences the success rate of 
stealing and a few weapon attacks.  It can be modified by equipment,
but, like PA and MA, the base Speed depends on a number of variables.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[7.2] the stats you don't know
      =========================================================================

Well, it turns out that your character's HP, MP, PA, MA, and Speed aren't 
the most basic stats after all. Squirrelled away in the bowels of the RAM are 
five three-byte values which govern every aspect of your character's stats 
and stat growth.

The stats you actually see are derived from these hidden parameters by 
these equations:

                    HP = [(HPP * ClassHPMult) / 1638400]
                    MP = [(MPP * ClassMPMult) / 1638400]
                    Sp = [(SpP * ClassSpMult) / 1638400]
                    PA = [(PAP * ClassPAMult) / 1638400]
                    MA = [(MAP * ClassMAMult) / 1683400]

Notes:
- If the final value is less than 1, it becomes 1 -- that is,
  revised_value = max{value, 1}.

- Enemy Zodiac beasts, in the special story battles where you fight them, 
  have unique equations that determine their HP and MP:

                    HP = [(HPP * ClassHPMult) / 163840] 
                    MP = [(MPP * ClassMPMult) / 163840]

  The division by 163,840 instead of by 1,638,400 accounts for the Zodiac 
  beasts' extremely high HP and MP despite their unremarkable multipliers.

The following subsections discuss the different components of the stat 
determination formula.


STATPOINTS
----------

> HPP, MPP, PAP, MAP, and SpP (HP Points, MP Points, PA Points, etc.) are 
  three-byte values (values between 0 and $FFFFFF, or 16777215). They are 
  stored at the following locations in the RAM (this is unimportant 
  unless you have a GameShark or other means of modifying the RAM):

                    STAT  BYTE 3     BYTE 2     BYTE 1
                    ----  ---------- ---------- ----------
                    HPP   $05xx8F    $05xx8E    $05xx8D
                    MPP   $05xx92    $05xx91    $05xx90
                    SpP   $05xx95    $05xx94    $05xx93
                    PAP   $05xx98    $05xx97    $05xx96
                    MAP   $05xx9B    $05xx9A    $05xx99

           (xx defines which character you're modifying, as with
            the job and sprite GameShark codes... $7F = unit 01,
            $80 = unit 02, $81 = unit 03, etc. To make GS codes 
            out of these addresses, just add '30' to the beginning 
            of the address [3005xx8F + 3005xx8E + 3005xx8D would be 
            the HPP modifier].)

  Collectively, I call these values a character's 'statpoints'.

  If byte 3 were $08, byte 2 were $3E, and byte 1 were $99, the statpoint 
  would have the value $083E99, or 540313. Note that the bytes are IN REVERSE 
  ORDER in terms of their RAM locations -- that is, because most hex editors
  display addresses increasing from left to right, byte 1 comes first in the 
  RAM, followed by byte 2, followed by byte 3, whereas in the value of the 
  actual statpoints, byte 3 is worth most, followed by byte 2, followed by 
  byte 1.

  How do you determine how many statpoints your character has? What follows 
  is a list of the initial statpoint values (i.e., at level 1) for different
  kinds of units.

  For human units, the initial value is a constant for a each gender for the 
  SpP, PAP, and MAP stats.  For monsters, which are all one gender and are 
  neither male nor female, only SpP is nonrandom.

                                     initial values
                         Gender   SpP     PAP     MAP
                         -------  ------  ------  ------
                         Male     98,304  81,920  65,536
                         Female   98,304  65,536  81,920
                         Monster  81,920  random  random

  Because the level up bonus is ultimately based on this initial value, 
  females will have better MA growth than males, and males will have better 
  PA growth than females.

  EXCEPTION:  Ramza starts with 81,920 of both PAP and MAP. 
  
  Monsters have randomized initial PAP and MAP values.  A monster's initial
  values will lie between the two extrema for each stat, inclusive.
                      
                  Gender    initial PAP        initial MAP 
                  -------   ----------------   ----------------
                  Monster   (81,920..98,303)   (81,920..98,303)

  However, HPP and MPP have random variation for all units, human and 
  monster; different units will start with different amounts of HPP and MPP 
  within a certain range:

                 Gender    initial HPP          initial MPP
                 -------   ------------------   ------------------
                 Male      (491,520..524,287)   (229,376..245,759)
                 Female    (458,752..491,519)   (245,760..262,143)
                 Monster   (573,440..622,591)   (98,304..147,455)

  Note that bred monsters, instead of having truly random stats, seem to 
  have their statpoints all selected at once from a set of 250-500 preset 
  'stat configurations'.  Bred monsters can have Brave and Faith ranging 
  from 40 to 70, unlike other randomly-generated monsters and units found 
  in battle, which can have Brave and Faith ranging from 45 to 74.


Consequences of the initial statpoint distribution:

  - females gain more MP and MA on level up than males
  - males gain more HP and PA on level up than females
  - monsters gain more HP, PA, and MA than either human sex;
    monsters gain less MP and Speed than either human sex (though the 
    Speed stat often rivals or exceeds humans because monster classes 
    tend to have lower C values for Speed than do human classes -- 
    see below).

  See section 7.3 for information on how stat point values change
  with level up.


STAT MULTIPLIERS

> ClassHPMult, ClassMPMult, ClassPAMult, etc. are multipliers peculiar to
  each class which determine the final value of each stat.  A table of 
  ClassMult values for the game's 150 or so classes follows. I've also 
  included Move, Jump, and inherent Evade% in the table so it can serve 
  as a compendium of sorts for class comparison.

  Some factoids based on the data below:

  - highest HP multiplier:     Great Morbol (181) 
                               Arc Knight [Elmdor] (180) 
  - highest MP multiplier:     Archaic Demon (200) 
                               Holy Priest (200) 
  - highest PA multiplier:     Dark Behemoth (200) 
  - highest MA multiplier:     Cleric (160)
  - highest Speed multiplier:  Arch Angel (150) 
  - highest Move:              Arch Angel (8)
  - highest Jump:              Assassin (7)
  - highest C-Evade:           Uribo (42%)

  - lowest HP multiplier:      Bard (50)
  - lowest MP multiplier:      Uribo (1)   
  - lowest PA multiplier:      Bard (60)  
  - lowest MA multiplier:      Knight Blade (50)  
  - lowest Speed multiplier:   Calculator (50) 
  - lowest Move:               tons of classes (3)
  - lowest Jump:               Ultima Demon (2)
  - lowest C-Evade:            Serpentarius (3%)
  ('lowest' values exclude zeroes)

A few words before the table:

- FFT's classes are divided into three main families:

  > HUMAN classes (00-5D) -- note that these include some classes that 
    are monsterlike in appearance, such as the Zodiac beasts.  Human 
    classes are characterized by the ability to use primary, secondary, 
    reaction, support, and move abilities.

  > MONSTER classes (5E-8D) -- these are monsters that have a fixed skill 
    set -- secondary abilities, reaction abilities, support abilities and 
    movement abilities, other than those that are inherent to each class,
    cannot be set on these classes.  They tend to have higher stats than 
    human classes, especially in the HP, PA, and MA departments.
   
  > HUMANOID classes (90-9A) -- these classes closely resemble humans, 
    and can equip different types of abilities (though you must use the 
    GS to do so).  These classes cannot use equipment, however -- in fact, 
    if you do put equipment on them using the Game Shark, it will 
    disappear in battle. Humanoid classes have stats comparable to 
    human ones.

- Classes differ in the level up bonuses that they impart.  This chart does 
  not take these bonuses into account; these data were gathered with level 
  at a constant.  For information on level up bonuses, see section 7.3.
  
- The HP and MP stats do not take equipment into account.  

- Though monsters have ClassMult values in the same range as humans, their 
  HPP, PAP, and MAP values will be substantially higher because they start 
  with more than humans do, and the level up bonus is a percentage of the 
  original statpoint value.  This explains the monsters' ridiculously high 
  PA and MA.  Monster classes also inherently receive more stat bonus -- 
  especially for MA -- on level up than do human classes.  See section 7.3.

[7.3] levelling up
      =========================================================================

HPP, MPP, SpP, PAP, and MAP are increased on level up.  Different classes -- 
as well as different sexes -- receive different statpoint bonuses on level up, 
which results in the classes' differing stat growth.

Stat point growth on levelling up is determined by the following equation:

                        bonus = [current_xP / (C + Lv)]

   where xP is a generic term for any stat point (HPP, MPP, SpP, PAP or MAP)
         Lv is the LOWER level in question -- so if you are levelling up
            from 50 to 51, Lv = 50.  
   
C is a constant that varies for each class; the value of C is what 
differentiates one class' growth pattern from another.  Keep in mind that 
since C is in the denominator of this expression, LOWER VALUES OF C YIELD 
HIGHER STATS. 

> Note that if you do not do any levelling down (see section 7.4 for the 
  effect of levelling down), it just so happens that the number of 
  statpoints you get on a level up will be a constant. That is, on a normal 
  levelling up route, the ratio of current_xP to (C + Lv) remains constant 
  -- meaning if you want to calculate the stat point increase from multiple
  level ups, you just have to calculate it once and multiply it by the 
  number of level ups.

The table of C values follows. A few observations based on the data:

- Thief and Ninja are the only generic classes that offer Speed bonuses 
  relative to the others:  Ninja's bonus is greatest.
- Mime is the best class for HP growth.
- Summoner is the best class for MP growth.
- Knight and Lancer are best for PA growth.
- Mime is the ONLY generic class that offers an MA bonus relative to 
  the others.
- Monsters gain a hell of a lot more HP, PA and MA than humans do 
  (especially MA -- notice how most monsters have a C value of only 7, 
  whereas the strongest human MA gainer has a C value of 35.
- I realize this isn't the most clear way to present which classes are 
  best at what, since the 'lower = better' concept is contrary to intuition
  and to the other tables in this FAQ. However, this is the way THE GAME 
  ACTUALLY DOES IT, and the aim of this file is to explain how the game 
  performs its various functions -- and not to sacrifice that to provide 
  the most user-friendly presentation of what those functions mean in 
  terms of gameplay.  The data may look strange, but the C values are 
  real.  I present them in this format rather than in decimal (and 
  therefore 'higher = better') form because rounding off to 4 or 5 
  decimal places would cause rounding error when multiple level-up 
  bonuses were applied -- 1/7 is different from 0.14286.
  
Some factoids:

HUMAN / HUMANOID
Best HP gainers:  Dragoner (C = 5), 
                  Mime (C = 6)
Best MP gainers:  Summoner, Assassin, Sorcerer (C = 8)
Best PA gainers:  Steel Giant (C = 30),
                  Mime, Divine Knight Vormav (C = 35)
Best MA gainers:  Byblos, Apanda (C = 35), 
                  Mime (C = 40)
Best Sp gainers:  Byblos (C = 75),
                  Ninja (C = 80)

MONSTER
Best HP gainers:  All Hydra class (C = 3)
Best MP gainers:  It's a 48-way tie! (all classes C = 30)
Best PA gainer:   Dark Behemoth (C = 34)
Best MA gainers:  Dark Behemoth, Red Dragon (C = 6)
Best Sp gainer:   Chocobo (yellow only) (C = 75)

                                    C values
                                (lower is better!)

[7.4] levelling down     
      =========================================================================

For years, FFT players have been using the 'level up/down' trick to build 
characters with super stats.  The idea behind the trick is that you level up 
in a job with strong stat growth (low C values) such as Ninja or Mime, and 
then level down (using Mindflare's 'Level Blast' technique or one of the 
many Degenerator traps scattered throughout the game's battlefields) with a 
class with poor stat growth (high C values) such as Bard or Dancer.  Though 
the game adjusts your stats when you level down so that you lose the stats 
that you would have gained as that class, by using poor classes to level down 
you can fool the game and lose less going down than you gain going up; in
this manner, you can build all your stats up to their maxima if you do enough 
levelling cycles.

Note though, that if you level up and down _without_ changing classes, you 
will actually _lower_ your stats.  This is because the level down algorithm 
is the following equation:

                     decrement = [current_xP / (Lv + C)]
   
     where Lv is the level you are levelling DOWN to (i.e., the lower
           level).  For instance, if you level down to 50 from level 51, 
           Lv = 50.

This results in a slight stat decrease.  Consider the following example.

Suppose you have a male Squire (491,520 < initial HPP < 524,288) with initial
HPP of 504,000.  Levelling up from 1 to 2, he will receive an HPP bonus as 
follows (C_HPP = 11):

bonus = [504,000 / (11 + 1)] = [504,000 / 12] = 42000.

Your new HPP at level 2 will be 546,000.  So if you level down from 2 to 1, 
your HPP will decrease as follows:

decrement = [546,000 / (11 + 1)] = [546,000 / 12] = 45500.

Your new HPP at level 1 will then be 546,000 - 45500 = 500,500 instead of 
504,000 as you had originally.

While this isn't that big of a decrease, if done all the way down from level 
99 to level 1, it can add up.  However, if you do change classes while 
levelling down, this small loss will be compensated for by the higher C 
values of the poor stat-gaining class that you level down as.

[7.5] list of inherent abilities
      =========================================================================

To complement the other information in this part of the guide, here is a list
of the inherent abilities, status immunities, and elemental strengths and 
weaknesses of every class in FFT.

Notation:
[ability names] - class always has these abilities set
I: - class is immune to these abnormal statuses/elements
S: - class starts the battle with this abnormal status
P: - class permanently has this abnormal status
A: - class absorbs this element
W: - class is weak against this element
H: - class halves this element

_______________________________________________________________________________
[A.1] action and reaction
      =========================================================================

Before considering FFT's gameflow, it is important to understand
the three following terms:

- A SLOW ACTION is any attack which requires a charging time between
  the time it is selected and the time when it is actually executed.
  Each slow action has an associated value known as 'ctr' (clockticks
  till resolution) which specifies this duration in clockticks.  Slow
  actions can only resolve during SR phases. 

- A FAST ACTION is any attack which is resolved immediately upon 
  selection.  Fast actions resolve during CR phases; slow actions
  can never resolve in a CR phase.

- A REACTION is any counterattack or ability immediately executed by
  the target of a just-resolved slow action, fast action, or act of
  mimicry.  Reaction abilities cannot be reacted to or mimed.  The
  nature of the reaction is determined by a unit's reaction ability.
  An altered version of Newton's third law governs reaction abilities
  in FFT: every action has a _chance_ to generate a reaction; however,
  as mentioned above, reactions do not count as actions themselves.

Simple, huh?  Now, for the good stuff...


_______________________________________________________________________________
[A.2] basic gameflow
      =========================================================================

* NOTE: This section is based ENTIRELY on the theory of
  gameflow developed by Aaditya Rangan <rangan@math.berkeley.edu>.  
  I, Aerostar, take NO credit for this information.  All credit 
  should go to Aaditya.


THE CHARACTER-LIST
------------------

At the beginning of each battle, enemy and ally characters are
assigned numbers in a character_list, as follows.

(1) Each enemy (red) formation comes with pre-selected enemy 
index_numbers. These units are numbered first in the character_list, 
starting at 01. 

(2) The numbers of the player (blue) units are determined by the 
player's placement of the units on the map before battle, in this 
order: 

                 ________________ 
                /_L_/_K_/_J_/_I_/
               /_H_/_G_/_F_/_E_/
              /_D_/_C_/_B_/_A_/

(the actual perspective seen in the game is this drawing rotated
 roughly 30 degrees clockwise)

The three 'rows' are ABCD, EFGH, and IJKL.  Sometimes a map will
have more rows than this, but you should be able to deduce the
pattern for any map from this drawing.

Squares are alphabetized (well, not really, but it makes it 
easier to visualize) in rows, the foremost row being considered first 
and the rearmost being considered last. Letter 'A' is assigned to the 
rightmost square in the foremost row. Blue units are then numbered 
sequentially on the character_list, starting from 17, based on the 
squares they are standing on in alphabetical order. 

In the case of multiple units with CT >= 100, the one with the lowest 
number on the character_list gets to go first. Since each unit has a 
unique number, this resolves all ties. 


PHASES OF BATTLE
----------------

Once the character_list is formed, gameflow proceeds as follows:

<do> 
S+ phase
SR phase
C+ phase
CR phase
Status Check 
<loop> 

This applies to ordinary battle situations -- i.e., 
no miming, critical quicking, counter-magic quick loops or the like.  
See sections A.3 and A.4 for that type of stuff. :)


~ S+ phase ~ 

One 'clocktick' is defined as the duration of time between two
consecutive S+ phases.

During this phase, the AT_list is checked, and every eligible 
slow-action has its ctr_countdown decremented by 1 (see below).

Every slow_action has some initial_ctr that counts down during 
the S+ phase. If two slow_actions reach zero at the same time, the 
slow_action spawned by the character with the lower number on the 
character_list is resolved first.

The initial ctr values are as follows: 

Charge +1 ............ 4 
Charge +2 ............ 5 
Charge +3 ............ 6 
Charge +4 ............ 8 
Charge +5 ........... 10 
Charge +7 ........... 14 
Charge +10........... 20 
Charge +20........... 35 
JUMP ................ [50 / (jumper's speed)] 
5 SP actions ........ 20 
7 SP actions ........ 15 
10 SP actions ....... 10 
12 SP actions ....... 9 
13 SP actions ....... 8 
15 SP actions ....... 7 
17 SP actions ....... 6 
20 SP actions ....... 5 
25 SP actions ....... 4 
34 SP actions ....... 3 
50 SP actions ....... 2 

'SP' refers to the Speed stat that is listed for the attack in
the game. Notice that SP will only take on the values 5, 7, 10, 
12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 25, 34, and 50. This is because it doesn't 
really exist per se: rather, it's just an encoded form of the 
ctr: SP = RU{100/ctr}. 

All slow_actions, EXCEPT THOSE ON THE LIST THAT FOLLOWS, have their 
initial ctr affected by Short Charge: 

short_ctr = RU{initial_ctr/2}. 

List of actions not affected by Short Charge: 
- JUMP command 
- CHARGE commands 
- SING commands 
- DANCE commands 

Slow_actions whose ctrs are altered by short-charge can also be 
made into fast_actions by the 'Non-charge' ability. In that case, 
they are treated *as* fast_actions and not as slow_actions. 
   
All active ctr_countdowns are decremented by 1 in the S+ phase, but 
nothing else can 'happen'. Character's don't gain CT, nobody gets 
any turns, and spells don't go off. Nothing happens. 


~ SR phase ~
 
During this phase, slow actions can resolve. That is, all the 
slow actions on the AT_list are checked, and all those whose
ctr_countdowns are at zero AND whose casters are healthy are executed. 
Slow actions that aren't fully charged are simply ignored.  

When a slow action resolves, each target, in character_list order, 
is given a chance to react (i.e., activate his reaction ability).

Characters don't increment CT during this phase. Slow actions don't charge 
up during this phase.  No characters can take any turns during this phase 
(with the exception of quick-turns, of course). 


~ C+ phase ~

During this phase, characters charge up their CT. Each character adds to 
his CT appropriately:

CT_increment = (character's Speed)

Even if a character's CT exceeds 100, the extra CT _will_ be stored 
(though not displayed on the CT bar).

No slow actions charge up in this phase, and no slow actions are resolved. 
No characters get any turns.


~ CR phase ~
 
During this phase, characters can take their standard (non-quick)turns. 
That is, characters get their 'natural' AT's during this phase. No slow 
actions charge. No slow actions resolve. No characters charge. During a 
character's turn he can execute a fast-action or he can start 
charging a slow-action.  If multiple characters have CT >= 100, the 
order is determined by the enumeration in the character_list; characters
with lower numbers go first

When a fast action resolves, each target, in character_list order, is
given a chance to react.  Reaction abilities are NOT considered fast
actions; they are 'faster than fast'.

Once a character takes a turn, his CT is decreased as follows:

If character moved and acted -->  new_CT = min(60, CT - 100)
If character moved but did not act --> new_CT = min(60, CT - 80)
If character acted but did not move --> new_CT = min(60, CT - 80)
If character neither moved nor acted --> new_CT = min(60, CT - 60)

Note that if you have 'Don't Move' or 'Don't Act', for CT purposes
the game always considers that you have already moved or acted: i.e.,
a 'Don't Move' character that waits or a 'Don't Act' character that
doesn't move will still have his CT reduced by 80.  If a unit has both
'Don't Move' and 'Don't Act', his CT will always be reduced by 100.


~ Status Check phase ~

The character_list is checked in order, and all status effects whose
ctr_countdowns have reached zero are removed.

The initial ctr_countdown values for the timed status effects follow:

STATUS          INITIAL CTR
-------------- -------------
Charm ........ 31 clockticks
Don't Act .... 23 clockticks 
Don't Move ... 23 clockticks
Faith ........ 31 clockticks
Haste ........ 31 clockticks
Innocent ..... 31 clockticks
Poison ....... 35 clockticks
Protect ...... 31 clockticks
Reflect ...... 31 clockticks
Regen ........ 35 clockticks
Shell ........ 31 clockticks
Slow ......... 23 clockticks
Sleep ........ 59 clockticks
Stop ......... 19 clockticks

After the status check, the loop has been traversed once and 
starts anew at the next S+ phase.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[A.3] the mime-cycle
      =========================================================================

Ah, Mimes... probably one of the most useless classes in Final
Fantasy Tactics because of the complexity involved in coordinating
their mimicry.  However, this one job, seldom actually used in the
game, presents a host of new gameflow possibilities due to its 
continual copying of whatever action just happened.  Well, sort of.

Whenever a fast action or slow action resolves, a mime-cycle ensues.  
During the mime-cycle, each mime in battle will have a chance to 
mimic the last action that was taken (call this the last_action).  
ONE last_action is stored in the game's memory, along with who 
performed that last_action.  Reaction abilities are NOT written into
the last_action.  If the Mime in question is not on the same team 
as the person who performed the last_action, the last_action is NOT 
mimicked (this prevents mimicking enemy actions).  Note that 
mimicked actions do NOT count as fast actions; they, like reaction 
abilities, are 'faster than fast'.  

Upon mimicking an action, the mime's target(s) get a chance to 
react to the mimicry in order determined by the character list;
then the next mime in the character_list mimics.  This goes on
until no more eligible mimes remain.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[A.4] the quick and the dead
      =========================================================================

Of all FFT's 400-or-so spells and effects, there is one that 
presents more gameflow nightmares than any other -- this is the
Time Mage spell, Quick, and its related reaction ability,
Critical Quick.

When a target is given the 'Quick' status, his CT is set to 100
(or sometimes 154 for mimed Quick -- probably a glitch) and he 
receives a 'quick-flag'.  This quick-flag indicates that the 
character is in line to receive a quick-turn.  A quick-turn is 
distinguished from a normal turn in that it can occur during
ANY phase of battle, not just the CR.

What creates the difficulty are our friends, the Mimes, which
can mimic the Quick spell and hand out quick-flags during the
mime-cycle!  And to boot, Quick can be Counter Magicked (WHY,
Squaresoft?!), which means a mimed Quick can be thrown back 
at the mime in the middle of the mime-cycle, creating a really
nasty gameflow mess.

To guide us through this mire of *cough* quick-sand *cough*, 
here is a superb analysis of the whole Quick-Mime-Counter Magic
from the gameflow guru, Aaditya Rangan <rangan@math.berkeley.edu>:

- Begin Aaditya's section.  What follows was NOT written by
  me, but by Aaditya Rangan.  This is some amazing stuff. -

-[QUOTE]-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PRELIMINARIES

0. An action (i.e., a fast action, or the resolution of a 
slow action) will always immediately spawn a reaction.  Every action
will ALWAYS allow for its targets to react.  In other words, nobody 
can take quick-turns in between an action and its reactions.  

1. A mime-cycle is when the mimes are checked in character_list order, 
and all the eligible mimes mimic the last_action.  After each mime 
mimics the last action, his target gets a chance to react.  Then the 
next mime on the list mimicks the last_action, and so on.  Mime-cycles 
are always completed. That is, they are never interrupted.  Nobody can 
take a quick-turn (of any type) in the middle of a mime-cycle.  So 
basically, all a mime-cycle can do (for my purposes) is hand out a bunch 
of quick-flags all over the place.  There is no way anybody can do 
anything 'funny' in the middle of a mime-cycle, and the mime-cycle 
is completely determined by the last_action (defined prior to the 
mime-cycle). 

2. The game sometimes checks for quick-turns in between actions 
and mime-cycles.  The game sometimes checks for quick-turns after 
mime-cycles.  This is why I must introduce the notion of a 'quick- 
safety'.  This can be either on or off.  The quick-safety is basically 
some bit toggled somewhere which switches the gameflow between 'safe' 
mode (no quick-turns happening here, no siree) and 'quick' mode (alas! 
must resolve multiple quick-turns).  The only reason I am introducing 
this quick-safety is that quick-turn resolution during SR phases makes 
NO SENSE without it.

3. There seem to be four different types of Quick. There is Quick (the 
spell); there is Critical Quick (the reaction); there is mime-Quick 
(when a character gets hit with the Quick spell during a mime-cycle); 
and there is mime-Critical Quick (when a character Critical Quicks 
during a mime-cycle).  As far as I can tell, Counter Magic-Quick (the 
reaction) and Quick (the spell) are equivalent.  So a character can 
have no quick flag, a quick-spell-flag, a critical-quick-flag, a 
mime-quick-spell-flag, or a mime-critical-quick-flag. I will denote 
these with N-flag, QS-flag, CQ-flag, MQS-flag and MCQ-flag respectively. 

4. As far as I can tell right now, the only observable difference 
between MQS and MCQ is that MQS raises CT to 100, whereas MCQ raises CT 
to 154 (what the hell is that all about?).  What is even more weird is 
that MCQ only raises CT to 154 most of the time -- sometimes it only 
raises CT to 100.  QS is definitely different from CQ, and I'm pretty 
sure CQ is different from MCQ. So I'm guessing that QS is different 
from MQS. 

5. As you probably guessed, the difference between QS and CQ has to 
do with the quick-safety. I'll get into that later.


ENTER THE JUNGLE

The standard way events are resolved is: 

1. Resolve the initial basic action (and redefine last_action). This 
step can apply a QS-flag. 

2. Resolve the initial reaction(s).  This step can apply (several) 
CQ-flags. It can also apply a QS-flag (via Counter Magic). 

3. Check the character_list for quick-flags.  If nobody has any 
quick-flags, head on to step 4.  Otherwise give the first quick-flagged 
character on the list a quick-turn.  This character can act, and 
redefine the last-action.  Then allow all appropriate reactions (hence 
applying CQ-flags).  After the reactions, ignore the rest of the 
quick-flagged characters on the character_list, and immediately skip to 
the... 

4. Mime-cycle.  Examining the last_action, all eligible mimes do their 
thing.  Each mime is checked in order of the character_list, and the 
first eligible mime acts (and triggers reactions).  Then the next 
eligible mime acts (and triggers reactions), and so on.  This allows 
the distribution of several MQS-flags or MCQ-flags.  At the end of the 
mime-cycle, the last_action is cleared (set to null). 

5. Check the character_list for quick-flags. If nobody has any 
quick-flags, head on to step 6.  Otherwise, give the first 
quick-flagged character on the list a quick-turn.  If that character 
acts, he redefines the last-action.  Then allow all appropriate 
reactions (hence applying cq-flags).  After this character's quick-turn 
is finished, go back to step 4. 

6. Now the initial basic action is considered to have ended. The 
last-action is cleared, and the game moves on. (If we were in an SR 
phase, the game would check for the next eligible slow-action, and (if 
it finds one) then head back to step 1).  If we were in a CR phase, 
the game would check for the next eligible character, and give them 
an AT.

So what's the problem? 

Well, often during SR phases, steps 3 and 5 above are SKIPPED. That is, 
characters who should get quick-turns are instead 'passed over' until 
later (this is where I get to the quick-safety)... Once I 
explain this, it should generalize to the CR phases.

(If you think that steps 3 and 5 are basically the same step, then 
you're right. I am pretty sure that 3 and 5 both involve calling the 
same subroutine to resolve the first quick-turn on the character_list. 
The only difference is that skipping 3 leads to 4, whereas skipping 5 
leads to 6 (a difference in the function call only, not the 
subroutine)). 

So here are some rules to fix all this wackiness. First assume that the 
game ONLY looks at step 3 and 5 if the quick-safety is OFF (that is, 
steps 3 and 5 are automatically skipped if the game is in 'safe' mode). 

a. At the beginning of step 1, the character_list is checked for 
quick-flags. If anybody has any quick-flags, the quick-safety is turned 
OFF (that is, the game enters 'quick' mode).  Otherwise, the 
quick-safety is turned ON (the game falls into 'safe' mode). 

b. If step 1 (or 2) applies a QS-flag, the quick-safety is turned OFF 
(note that application of a CQ-flag does NOT turn the safety off).  So 
if the initial actor quick-spells somebody (or is hit by Counter 
Magic-Quick), then the game is put into 'quick' mode. 

c. Now, after step 2, the game will enter step 3 only if it is in 
'quick' mode.  If the quick-safety is on, the game will skip straight 
to step 4. 

d. At the beginning of step 4, the character_list is checked for 
quick-flags.  If anybody has any quick-flags, the quick-safety is turned 
off.  Otherwise, the quick-safety is not altered.  The quick-safety is 
not altered during the resolution of the mime cycle. That is, the 
application of MQS-flags or MCQ-flags won't switch the game into 'quick' 
mode.  So unless the quick-safety was OFF to begin with, the game will 
skip straight to step 6 after the mime-cycle. 

e. During step 6, the quick-safety is turned ON (and the game is put 
back into 'safe' mode).

Now, this explains everything I have observed so far.  Quick-spell (and 
Counter Magic-Quick) will immediately put the game into quick mode. That 
means that somebody will get a quick-turn before the resulting mime-cycle. 
Critical Quick will NOT put the game into quick-mode, until AFTER step 3 
(at the beginning of step 4). That means that CQ won't trigger a quick- 
turn until after the resulting mimecycle. 

In addition (and this is the most important part), MimeQS and MimeQC will 
NOT switch the game into quick mode. That means that if the game is in 
safe mode BEFORE the mime-cycle, and then some MimeQS-flags or MimeCQ-flags 
are applied, those quick-turns get skipped until later (until the next 
'step 3' comes around, to be more precise).


SUMMARY
-------

Here's a more concise version of what goes on.

The above steps can be rewritten as follows: 

1. Resolution of basic initial action: 
1a. If there are any quick-flags, turn quick-safety OFF. 
1b. Resolve basic inital action, handing out QS-flags as needed. 
1c. Rewrite last_action appropriately. (including information about 
the action taken, and the team that took that action). 
1d. Go on to step 2. 

2. Resolution of basic initial reaction(s): 
2a. Resolve basic initial reaction(s) (in character_list order), 
handing out QS-flags and CQ-flags as needed. 
2b. If there are any QS-flags, turn quick-safety OFF.
2c. If the quick-safety is off, go to step 3. 
2d. If the quick-safety is on, go to step 4. 

3. Resolution of the first quick-turn: 
3a. Check the character_list for the first fellow with a quick-flag. 
3b. Give that sap a turn. 
3c. If he acts, rewrite the last_action appropriately. 
3d. If he acted, resolve all the reactions, and hand out the CQ-flags 
as needed. 
3e. Go on to step 4. 

4. Mime-cycle: 
4a. If there are any quick-flags, turn quick-safety OFF. 
4b. Go through the mime-cycle (I won't bore you with the details), 
handing out MQS-flags and MCQ-flags as necessary. 
4c. Clear the last_action (rewrite it to empty). 
4d. If the quick-safety is off, go to step 5. 
4e. If the quick-safety is on, go to step 6. 

5. Resolution of the first quick-turn: 
5a. Check the character_list for the first fellow with a quick-flag. 
5b. If there aren't any quick-flags, go on to step 6. 
5c. Otherwise, give the first character on the charcter_list a 
quick-turn. 
5c. If he acts, rewrite the last_action appropriately. 
5d. If he acted, resolve all the reactions, and hand out the CQ-flags 
as needed. 
5e. Go back to step 4. 

6. End of action: 
6a. If in an SR phase, turn quick-safety on. 
6b. If in an SR phase, look for the next slow-action on the 
character_list. 
6c. Once you find it, go back to step 1.


EXAMPLE
-------

Now here is an easily reproducible example that illustrates the need 
for the quick-safety. 

A,B and C all have CT 100, speed 99, and Short Charge. 
D and E are mimes. 
A starts casting Quick (targets an empty panel) 
B waits 
C waits 

(time passes, and every character's CT increments) 

A, B, C all wait 

(time passes) 

A's Quick goes off, and misses 
D mimes A and hits C 
E mimes A and hits B 

(every character's CT increments) 

Now, during the subsequent CR phase, the turn order is 
B, C, A 

As you can see, B and C definitely got quick-flags (MQS-flags, to be 
exact). But they did not get quick-turns until the following CR phase. 
In other words, they were ignored during the SR phase. There was a 
mime-cycle during the SR phase (after A's quick-spell went off). And 
yet B and C did NOT get quick-turns right after the mime-cycle. The 
reason is that at the beginning of the mime-cycle, nobody had any 
quick-flags, and so the game stayed in 'safe' mode. 

Here is a slightly different example. 

A,B and C all have CT 100, speed 99, and Short Charge. 
D and E are mimes. 
A starts casting Quick (targets an empty panel) 
B and C wait. 

(time passes, and every character's CT increments) 

B starts casting Haste (targets an empty panel) 
C starts casting Haste (targets an empty panel) 

(time passes) 

A's Quick spell goes off, missing. 
D mimes A, and hits C with a Quick spell 
E mimes A, and hits B with a Quick spell 
B's Haste spell goes off 
B gets a quick-turn 
B waits 
D mimes B, and hits C with a Haste spell 
E mimes B, and hits C with a Haste spell 
C gets a quick-turn 
C waits 

(every character's CT increments) 

Now, during the subsequent CR phase, the turn order is 
A, B, C 

Now you can see the effect of the quick-safety. Since there were no 
quick-flags during A's action, the game was left in safe mode. So after 
the resultant mime-cycle, C and B were ignored. However, at the 
beginning of B's haste spell, the game switched to 'quick' mode. Then, 
B got a quick-turn BEFORE the resultant mime-cycle. After B finished,

every character's CT incremented.

Well, that pretty much covers gameflow -- thanks again to Aaditya Rangan for

                            & A C C E S S O R I E S

This is a list of all the weapons, armor, and accessories in the game. Here's
a guide to the information you'll find:

NAME:    name of the item

##:      the game's internal reference number (in hex) for the item 
         (useful for GameShark codes and the like)

WP:      weapon power (for weapons)

Ev:      weapon evasion (for weapons)

HP+:     amount of HP this item will add when equipped (for armor)

MP+:     amount of MP this item will add when equipped (for armor)

PRICE:   price to buy the item in a standard shop, in gil. some items can
         only be bought from Fur Shops, in which case they'll be half of this
         cost. some items can't be bought at all (many of these have prices of
         10 gil)

E.LV:    random enemies will start using the item at this level. this means
         - randomly generated units will be able to equip it at this level
           and above
         - enemy units with THROW will be able to THROW it at this level and
           above
         if this number is enclosed in parentheses, this means that random
         enemies cannot equip the item. for instance, Defender has "(92)" here.
         this means that you'll never see a random enemy with a Defender
         equipped, although enemy Ninjas with 'Knight Sword' learned will be
         able to THROW it starting at level 92. non-random enemies (e.g.,
         Meliadoul, Dycedarg) also may equip this type of item.


TERMS USED IN ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

"Add:" means that an ATTACK with the weapon will add the listed status effects 
to the target if it connects. This will only happen a certain amount of the
time (usually 25%).

"Auto-" before the name of a status effect means that this piece of equipment
automatically gives its wearer this status, and the status cannot be removed
unless the equipment is removed. If the equipment is removed, broken, or 
stolen, auto-status will immediately be removed. 

"Block:" means that the unit equipped with this item is protected from the
listed status effects and/or elements. In the case of status effects, any
attempt to add the status effect will be reduced to a 00% success rate. In 
the case of elements, any attack that causes damage carrying the listed 
elements will have a 00% success rate.

"Initial-" before the name of a status effect means that the wearer of this
piece of equipment will start each battle with that status effect. The effect
will not be added if you use 'Equip Change' to equip the item mid-battle, and
it will not be removed if the item is removed, stolen, or broken (unless 
something else that happens in the course of removing, stealing, or breaking
the item would have normally caused the status effect to disappear).

"M:" means that an ATTACK with the weapon will randomly cast the spell listed
after normal attack damage is dealt. This seems to happen 20-25% of the time.

'YES Two Swords' means that one of this type of weapon may be held in each hand
using the 'Two Swords' support ability.

'YES Two Hands' means that equipping the 'Two Hands' support ability will allow
you to grip this type of weapon in both hands, doubling damage.

'Both hands only' means that the weapon can only be held in both hands, and 
that 'Two Hands' has no effect on the weapon's damage.

* This FAQ is dedicated to Dr Gamewiz (1936-1999),          *
* whose years of selfless service to the the Internet       *
* gaming community were an inspiration to us all.  The      *
* Doc, as he was affectionately called, ran a forum         *
* on America Online for many years, founded on the          *
* principle of 'gamesters helping gamesters'.  It was       *
* the best place on AOL to find hints, codes,               *
* walkthroughs, and altogether nice people, united by the   *
* Gamewiz slogan, 'BOOLAH!'.  There were message boards,    *
* newsletters, file repositories, and a weekly newsletter   *
* -- the Doc would never miss an issue.  Everyone who       *
* regularly visited the Gamewiz forum agreed:  there was    *
* just something wonderful and magical about it.  Many      *
* friendships were forged there, some of which are still    *
* going strong.  In 1997, however, AOL terminated its       *
* contract with the Doc, opting instead to back Antagonist  *
* Online, a larger, more impersonal forum whose name        *
* pretty well reveals its nature.  Though many Gamewiz      *
* regulars became disaffected, the Doc, ever the            *
* optimist, continued assiduously preparing the             *
* newsletters and kept running his trivia games.  Even      *
* in the face of terminal cancer, the Doc rarely missed     *
* an issue.  On September 28, 1999, Dr Gamewiz passed       *
* away -- even his eternal optimism could not ward off      *
* the terrible disease.  And so, Doc, this FAQ is for       *
* you.  Wherever you are now, I hope it makes you           *
* smile.  Thanks for giving so much of yourself, and        *
* know that your work does not go unappreciated.            *
* BOOLAH!                                                   *
*                 --Aerostar                                *
